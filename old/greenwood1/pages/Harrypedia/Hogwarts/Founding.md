### Founders

While the books give us sufficient information to make good guesses about Godric
Gryffindor, for the other three we have only geographic clues that could mean
anything. Other fans with presumably more knowledge of the United Kingdom have
made inferences that supposedly make sense.

#### Godric Gryffindor

Godric is from Old English, also dying out after the Norman
Conquest.[^210422-5] I am told, and the baby names etymology site seems to
concur, that "Old English" essentially means "Anglo-Saxon."[^210422-6] He is
supposedly from a village later renamed after him, in the West
Country.[^210422-8] This more or less works, the vikings might well have
pushed the Anglo-Saxon west enough by the time Godric was born.[^210422-9]

#### Helga Hufflepuff

Helga is an Old Norse name, used in England "before the Norman
Conquest."[^210422-4] The consensus is that she is from Wales.[^210422-10]
The name and location pair is a conundrum, she should be from one of the Viking
invasions, but I do not know of those settling in Wales. Perhaps this is why she
ended up migrating north, her family was perhaps unwelcome in their home
town/village.

#### Rowena Ravenclaw

Rowena is an interesting name in that it apparently has an unclear etymology. I
find very different explanations on different name origin sites, and Wikipedia
pretty much just says unknown.[^210422-3] The consensus is that she is from
what is now Scotland,[^210422-11] though of course that did not exist
yet.[^210422-12]

#### Salazar Slytherin

Salazar is a _last name_ from Castile.[^210422-7] Vikings certainly raided
the Iberian Peninsula through this century,[^210422-13] my guess is that
someone decided to name a child after one of the places they pillaged. As
[his][Salazar] wand is snakewood,[^210422-14] which is not native to Europe, I
think his Viking origin is fairly solid. I suspect he at some point joined a
voyage to the new world, but given where snakewood exists, he must have heard
rumours of the various civilisations further south and gone to study with them
for a time. From my own knowledge of the Aztecs and Toltecs suggests that this
would not have been a positive influence on his life. If he was attracted to
the dark arts, it may well date from this period.

### Meeting and Starting a School

That the four of them meet at all, and more, become friends, suggests that while
this period of history is a series of rather small kingdoms at war in the United
Kingdom, the magical civilisation must have been more broadly connected despite
the non-magical politics. Otherwise the idea that Godric would make his way
from the West Country in the southern most parts of England up across at least
one other kingdom into a third in the tenth century is rather absurd. Why would
you? There were no organised trade networks that widely spread, no real centres
of scholarship in England or Scotland at all yet, and lots of very suspicious
people who would dislike and probably attack you for being foreign.

My guess is that Hogwarts is in Scotland because Helga was unwelcome at home,
Salazar was functionally nomadic, and of the two remaining founders, Rowena's
home in Scotland was probably more easily isolated and hidden from the
non-magical population than Godric's in the south.

    I'm assuming that both Dean Thomas and the Death Eaters would
    have regarded Dean as a first generation wizard. We are told Dean did not know
    about his father, and if the Death Eaters did, they would have considered him a
    blood traitor anyway. Thus that makes at least one student who went into hiding
    unsuccessfully.
