For all that mythological accounts of giants go back beyond history, the
reality is that giants are the newest of the races descendant from the
nephilim. One would think that the nephilim would learn something watching
the mistakes of others:

- the dwarfs given the hereditary curse of transformation into goblins for
  the creation of trolls.
- the nephil girl given the hereditary curse of transformation into veela for
  the creation of doxies and fairies.
- the siren given the hereditary curse of transformation into merrow for the
  creation of leprechauns.

Unfortunately, Nephilim seem particularly resistant to learning.[^230717-4]
It is perhaps for this reason that when one wealthy but indolent family
took a small mammal and used it to create the [House Elves], they were
punished in a particularly harsh way. Many scholars speculate that the
intent of this punishment is to create an example that will finally create
a lasting impression that some things are _**not to be done**_.

Church records show that the family was given, for lack of a better word,
gigantic forms. Averaging twenty feet tall, with proportionately thick
fingers, the newly created giants found themselves unable to manipulate
books (for either education or entertainment) or tools of any kind. Not
only that, and worse (from a nephil's perspective) they were stripped of
all magic except that necessary to keep these unnatural forms alive.
Lastly, their intellects were so clouded that they are essentially
incapable of rational discourse. In their now mentally crippled state,
they quickly (and accidentally) freed their House Elf servants. Between
their clumsy forms, clouded intellects, and quick tempers, they are unable
to form any sort of civilisation beyond the crude hunter-gatherer tribe.
When neighbouring families attempted to render aid, they found that the
skin of this new race acts as a shield protecting them from all external
magic, so that the example they form of why creating humanoid life is evil
cannot be undone.
