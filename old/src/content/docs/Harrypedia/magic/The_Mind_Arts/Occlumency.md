title: "The Mind Arts: Occlumency"
author: "Luke Schierer"

Occlumency is the art, one who practices it is an Occlumens.

This is another topic on which the books themselves are either incredibly
incomplete, or utterly impossible.  The interview quoted at the [Harry
Potter fandom wiki](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/) on
Occulumency[^20191119-1] makes the situation worse, not better.  In the
interview, she is asserting that [Professor Snape]'s description of
Occulumency is accurate - that it is the practice of compartmentalizing
and/or suppressing emotion and memories. This is further confirmed in her
[article on Draco][WWJKRDM1] on what used to be Pottermore.[^20200630-7]

There are three problems with this.  One, it isn't really practical.  In
_The Grass Is Always Greener_[^20191119-2], Daphne describes what this
would be like in practice:

> Keep your eyes closed and let your mind go still. You can't think of
  nothing for very long, therefore you must think of something. So I want you
  to find a memory, or really an image, of something that is very neutral,
  very same, very uniform, and preferably all encompassing. It can be an
  image of the sky, the water in the ocean if you've been there, a large
  table cloth that's a single color, or whatever you know and can easily
  pull up.[^20191119-3]

[Harry] later figures out what this would be like to hold all the time:

> Harry had been diligently practicing his clearing of the mind every spare
  moment he had. He was proud of himself for a small break through he had
  had yesterday. He had finally figured out how to find the dark blanket,
  as he thought of it now, and still remain "normal". The result was
  something like a thin black haze across his vision and slightly reduced
  hearing. Still, now he knew he could have something of a shield up and
  still know what was going on around him, unlike being blind and almost
  deaf the first time he had done it with Daphne.[^20191119-4]

In that story, [Harry] chooses the "view" of a room without light - total
darkness.  This works, but basically means both reduced sight and,
because he's partially focusing on something else, reduced awareness
overall.  Are you really going to duel like that, as [Professor Snape]
suggests when fighting [Harry] in Chapter 28 of _the Half-Blood
Prince_[^20191119-5]? People really can't effectively multitask that way.
You can concentrate on your cleared mind, or on what is happening around
you (to be able to react to stray curses for example) but not on both.

Secondly, it is not even really consistent.  [Professor Snape] is
described as a master at Occulumency.  However, he is *constantly* showing
his anger, hatred, and scorn.  It is not only the positive emotions that
can be used against you, anger can be used against you as well.  The man
who cannot look past [James Potter] to see [Harry] Potter cannot depend on
compartmentalization to keep his mind in control.  The man who, in that
same chapter, totally loses control just because [Harry] attempts to use
his own spell[^20191119-6] is a master at emotional control?  It does not
make sense.

Thirdly, shutting down emotions, suppressing them, is not particularly
healthy.  While it is a common short term strategy, and can even be a
viable one in the fact of a trama situation, long term it will cause
problems with your ability to form and maintain interpersonal
relationships[^20200630-4], long term health problems (probably due to
stress)[^20200630-5], and others that you can find on google. Basically, it
is really really bad advice for long term use.  On one hand, it certainly
describes [Snape]. On the other, is this really the recommendation that
[Dumbledore] has for [Harry], whose supposed power is love?  Either it had
no chance of working (which seems to be Mrs. Rowling's theory, in the [Draco]
article, but come on, really?) in which case [Dumbledore] really is throwing
[Harry] to the wolves, or [Dumbledore] does not really care about the damage
this might do to [Harry], in which case he must not really much believe his
own theory about [Harry]'s love being supper important.

The tone of the Draco article[^20210922-1] strongly implies that [Harry]
had no chance of getting Occlumency to work. I think it need not have been
that way, but I think it is clear at this point that the author's intent
for Occlumency is fairly clear.  The problem then is not so much Occlumency,
but rather [Legilimency].
