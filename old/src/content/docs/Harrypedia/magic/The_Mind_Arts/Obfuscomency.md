This hypothetical mental defense consists of carefully arranging true and false
memories in a spiral pattern within your mind,[^211013-1] rather than in a
[Mind Palace](../mind_palace) type construct.  The idea is that the
attacker will
in fact get in, but will be forced down a pre-selected and time-consuming path
through your memories.  You are essentially assuming that the attacker has
either limited time, limited patience, or both in which to attack you.
