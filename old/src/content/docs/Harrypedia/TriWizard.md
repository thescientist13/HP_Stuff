In _[Dreams][fed]_ Epeefencer has the families of the champions come before the
first event, not just the third.[^20210304-2] I asked about that in a review,
and got back the response that he did this deliberately, that it did not make
sense to him that for an event this big that the family would only be invited for
the last task.  This makes sense to me.  I *suspect* Mrs. Rowling invited the
families to the last task because of the risk of death in the last task, a risk
that was tragically made real when Cedric was killed, ironically after the task
should have ended.[^20210304-3]  If you think about the *first* task, the was an
equally real risk of death.  No matter how alert and well intentioned the
handlers, a blast of dragon fire could well be fatal before they could step in.
