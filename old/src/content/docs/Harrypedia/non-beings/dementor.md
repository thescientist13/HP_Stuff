### Level of Intelligence

This "creature" has sufficient sentience that [Fudge]
uses them as a bodyguard.[^211021-1]  Similarly, despite [Dumbledore][]'s
warning that they will not differentiate between bystanders and targets, they
*do* seem capable of following orders to some degree.[^211021-2]

### Inconsistencies

They breed, causing mists or fogs,[^211021-3] but also grow like fungi *instead*
of breeding,[^211021-4] and also reduce you to something like itself.[^211021-5]
That is essentially three different forms of reproduction.

They are blind, and yet navigate spaces presumably using some magical form of
radar.  This magical navigation is apparently mostly blind to animals, but this
causes them no problems in the wild.

They are described as [non-beings][] but have bodies that can hold onto you.

[non-beings]: <../../>

### Imponderables

If a person receives the "Dementor's Kiss," what *actually* happens?  Does the
Dementor somehow destroy an immortal soul?[^211020-6]  Does the Dementor trap
the soul within it?[^211021-7]  Is this why the body does not die?[^211021-8]

It is said that the Dementor affects a person's ability to use magic.  Is this
actually true, or is it that the Dementor causes depression, and *that* affects
the ability to use magic?[^211021-9]

It is said that they feed on positive emotions.  Why is it that the
[Patronus][], which is the *embodiment* of those emotions, repels them?  The
explanation that it is because the [Patronus][] cannot feel despair fails to
satisfactorily explain.
