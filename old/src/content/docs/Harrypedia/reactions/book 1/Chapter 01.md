The first chapter, as is expected *of* a first chapter, has more questions than answers.  However, the nature of a few of those questions is already, even this early in the series, indicative. 

* It says that [Dursley][Vernon] is a "director" of the firm.  This term was, interestingly enough, *not* translated for the American editions, despite the fact that as best I can tell, they do *not* mean someone on the board of directors, but something more akin to a president of the company employed by the board.  
* The description of the [Dursley] family is highly reminiscent of a [Dickens] work.  That might be me reading into it though from familiarity with the series. 
* November 1st is a workday, thus a school day, yet the cat is there from the beginning of [Dursley][Vernon]'s day.  We will find out latter in this chapter that she is doing so on her own initiative and not as an assignment from either the [Ministry] nor from [Dumbledore].  Who is covering her classes?  Her responsibilities as Head of House?  Is she already Deputy Head of School? 
* While people are described as being in strangely dressed, and their cloaks are noticeable, [Dursley][Vernon] does *not* remark on the men wearing dresses (as he would no doubt think robes *are* dresses).  The clothing choices may not fit in, but robes are *not* ubiquitous.  Where does the insistence on robes come from? 
* It is very curious that [Dumbledore], who will go on in later books to invariably refer to [Riddle] by his birth name, has spent years persuading others to *use* that made up anagram.  [Dumbledore] claims fear of the name induces fear.  One would think that encouraging others to, like he himself does, ignore the anagram in favour of [Riddle]'s birth name, would achieve the reduction of fear even *more* effectively.  Has Mrs. Rowling, despite her later claims, not in fact thought out this plot point at this early date?[^240424-1]
* As this is November, [Harry] cannot be less than three months old, and may be as much as 18 months old. At that age, the differences are profound.  Babies start to crawl between seven and 12 months, but some may be *walking* by as early as 12, much less 18.  Has [Harry] been spelled or potioned to sleep through the night?  If so, when? Equally, if so, why ask if [Hagrid] had any trouble?
* We see no evidence of [Dumbledore] using [Lily]'s sacrifice to place protections on the house or family.  It is clear from the next that neither has [McGonagall].  Any such protections are either woven into the letter we do see and triggered by it, were placed before [McGonagall] arrived, or were placed when [Dumbledore] *returns* at some unknown point.
  * If triggered by the letter, does this explain why they did not knock on the door?  Does this mean that [Harry] is *not* particularly extra protected, in ways he would not be in literally any house or place, until [Petunia] opens the letter? 
  * If placed before she arrived, there is a *very* narrow window for it to have happened in unless [Dumbledore] planned everything *before the attack.*  I wish, if only to make him a less evil character, I could eliminate that possibility.
  * If placed at some subsequent time, there is a window of time that [Harry] is incredibly vulnerable.

[^240424-1]: There is some evidence of this, Mrs. Rowling calls the device that [Dumbledore] uses a "Put-Outer" but it will later be called by the more elegant name "Deluminator."
