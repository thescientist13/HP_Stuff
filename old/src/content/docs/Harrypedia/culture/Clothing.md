Mrs. Rowling insists that wizards wear robes.[^200723-4] The problem is that
she claims that this is because Wizarding fashion is intentionally frozen in the
17th century. This is a problem because while academics, clerics, and scholars
wore robes in the 17th century, male fashion varied considerably for those in
other occupations. This is very much part of the era of doublets and
hose.[^200723-5] Sometimes guys wore "over-gowns" other decades they did not.
Sometimes the doublets were more or less "skirted."  Some decades codpieces were
in evidence. For the [Hogwarts] uniform to be robe based is one thing, but
wizards seem to come from every strata of society. It is highly unlikely that
they all view themselves as court scholars; surely some of them would have
preferred a more lordly self-image, others a more martial self-image. The styles
of the century she cites allow for both.

Mrs. Rowling then contradicts her earlier insistence on robes, saying that "Day
to day, however, even those who detest Muggles wear a version of Muggle clothing,
which is undeniably practical compared with robes."[^210420-11]  This makes sense,
the working classes and farming families would have wanted something more practical,
even if they did use magic in place of manual labour as much as possible and
even when somewhat unreasonable. Still, who seriously wears robes with little
or nothing under them to do such classic Wizarding things like flying a broom
([Quidditch] robes‽) or duelling?

The real question then is how the girls dress. She says that "Women's dresses
tend to be long,"[^220630-1] but do they always wear either robes or dresses?
Magic allows for greater gender equality, and the society described in the
books *mostly* supports that, though it hints that there may be some severe
social limitations on married witches, and what is "proper" versus what is
"allowed." To what extent have the girls followed the non-magical trends of
their youth, and to what extent (if different) have they also adopt activity
appropriate garb? If only the [Quidditch] players adopt activity appropriate
garments, that might well be why girls playing [Quidditch] is not "proper."

Looking at [Hogwarts], [Ron] asks [Hermione] to leave so that he and [Harry]
can change on the train in the first book,[^210525-8] the third book has no
mention of changing clothing, and while the fourth[^210525-9] and
fifth[^210525-10] books do, it is one line that just says it happens. It is
almost as if they just pull on their robes over their clothing in the fourth
and fifth book, except that you would not use the word "change" for that. It
would also contradict the scene from [Snape's] memory where after being
flipped upside down, [James] threatens to remove his underwear.[^210525-11] In
book six, [Harry] does _not_ change, and loses points for his "muggle"
clothing,[^210525-12] again refuting the movies and the many fan fictions with
school uniforms that are essentially standard non-magical school uniforms with
an open robe.

This is not, however, just a simple matter of [Hogwarts] using a version of
traditional academic dress. Every description of Mr. and Mrs. Weasley's
clothing across the books has them wearing robes except when attempting to
appear deliberately non-magical (which it says [Mr. Weasley] does badly). If
"standard" wizarding clothing is in fact based on academic dress, then I can
see that [Mr. Weasley] might well wear something more formal, and thus, per this
logic, robes, to work. Why though do we not hear about [Mrs. Weasley] in the
"long dresses" that Mrs. Rowling says that women tend to wear? She does not
work, and one would think that academic dress, being synonymous with formal
wear, would be more expensive than the essentially non-magical clothing that
she says magical folk tend to wear "day to day."[^220630-2]

    It is curious that the American edition does not translate the word "pants"
    in this context, because it means something quite different in British
    versus American English.
