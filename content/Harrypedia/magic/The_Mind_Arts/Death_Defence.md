[[!meta title="The Mind Arts: Instant Death Defence"]]

This unnamed defensive technique is only partially described, and thus only
partially known.[^211026-1]  The basic theory seems to be a magical tripwire of
sorts within the mind that a [[legilimens|Legilimency]] will trigger.  Once
triggered, the magical defence causes the brain death of the attacker, usually,
but not always, followed immediately by actual death.
