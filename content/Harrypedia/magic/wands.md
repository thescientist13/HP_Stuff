* There is a fascinating article on [wand wood][20210126-1] and the
  personality traits and skills that go along with each.[^200723-1]
* Mr. Ollivander's notes in the above article are incomplete: 
  * [Umbridge][] has a birch wand,[^210511-4] and is also
    on her original list of Celtic woods when she talks about
    wands.[^210511-7]
  * [James Potter][] had a mahogany wand.[^210511-5]
  * ivy is on the list of Celtic woods that Mrs. Rowling posted when she first
    talked about wand woods.[^210511-6] 
  * [Fleur][] had a rosewood wand.[^210511-8] 
  * various other woods appear to be introduced by the Fantastic Beasts prequel
    stuff.  [WizardingWorld][ww] seems to mention some of them, and has been
    mined for information in [this article][20210511-9].
* The one on [size and flexibility][20210126-2] is more abbreviated, but points 
  out that you must not be too literal.[^200723-2]
  * Notably, length is *not* associated with power.[^221219-1]
  * Nor is it a vanity thing.[^221219-2]  It is easy to make a joke about
    wizards and their wands.  This is debunked.
* Mr. Ollivander has researched wand cores and will use only three of
  them.[^200723-3] There seems to be some ambiguity about which Mr. Ollivander.
  * Most of Mrs. Rowling's own writing almost acts as if the current Mr.
    Ollivander is the only Mr. Ollivander despite the fact that the sign
    outside the shop door states that the family has been making wands since 382
    B.C.[^210512-1]  I am willing to accept that wizards live longer than
    non-magical persons, but not by that much.  For there to only be one Mr.
    Ollivander would require that he be approximately 2373 years old! If such
    were true, then Nicholas Flamel's mere 665 years[^210512-2] would not
    really be noteworthy at all, and the philosopher's stone entirely
    unnecessary.  
  * Indeed, [the article on cores][20210126-3] directly states that the current
    Mr. Garrick Ollivander inherited the business from his father.[^210512-4]
  * Given there have been an entire succession of Ollivanders making and selling
    wands, which "Garrick Ollivander"[^210512-3] actually did the research and
    published the notes we are relying on? 
* Others are possible, but [the article on cores][20210126-3]
  was, like the other two, written as if by him and so focuses on those three.
  * Earlier Ollivanders were less fastidious about their wand cores.[^210512-5]
    Does the shop still hold wands made by these earlier Ollivanders?  If so, is
    the current Mr. Ollivander willing to sell these wands, or only ones that
    meet his (higher) bar for quality? 
* old-crow in his fan fiction _[The Core Wars][]_ speculates that perhaps as
  many as ¾ of witches and wizards used what he terms "legacy"
  wands.[^230103-1]  How common is it in fact to buy one's own wand?  This
  story correctly points out that the wand maker's opinion on the subject may
  not be unbiased.

Given the above articles I talk some about [Harry][]'s wand on the page
dedicated to him.  [Riddle][]'s wand, I think it is fairly inevitable that he
would have a yew wand, but I am somewhat surprised that he would have a phoenix
feather core.  While it does say it is the most capable, in a sense, it says
dragon heartstring is the most powerful.  Would [Riddle][] value range and or
power more?  He would certainly dislike that the phoenix feather wand might
sometimes act of its own accord.[^200806-5]  Naturally eleven year old [Riddle][]
knows nothing of wand lore and so is not deciding this, yet still, the wand
must sense something of the wizard it is bonding with…
