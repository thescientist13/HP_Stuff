This did not occur to me until it was pointed out, but why does the Trophy Room
contain Riddle's Award for Special Services to the School at all?[^20210520-1]
I do not know if this is typical of British schools or not, by my own high
school's trophy case only contained team trophies, awards won by the school as
a whole, and trophies intended to be presented to a student year after year
(typically containing a multitude of mini plaques on them one of which would
get engraved each year).  Something specific to a single student should be
*that student's*.  The trophy case did not contain the various medals the guys
on my wrestling team won at tournaments, nor did it contain the ones I got at
science fairs.
