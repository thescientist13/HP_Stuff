## Wizarding World Culture

Of all the many world building elements in the Harry Potter series, this is 
perhaps the most debated.  Mrs. Rowling has given us a very incomplete and at 
times contradictory look into the world that [[Harry]] re-encounters as he turns 
eleven.  Just how separate is the "Wizarding World" from that which those
without magic inhabit? How many of the differences are due to the school
environment that dominates the books?  How many real differences does a school
environment populated by adolescents suppress?  Fanfiction has explored any number
of paths by adding all sorts of details as different fans have needed different
elements to make their stories work. 

### Household Magic

While the books suggest that [[Molly|adults/Molly]] has her children do their
chores largely without magic, I simply cannot see wealthy teen-aged girls going
to social events without magical assistance, be it charms for their hair,
magical replacements for make-up (either charms, potions, or both), charms for
clothing (both for fit and to make the appearance more … magical), so on.  Some
of this may be built into the fabric when it is purchased, but I am reminded of
the descriptions of elfin women in _The Elvenbane_[^210329-20].  In that series,
the women use their appearance and clothing to display their magical prowess,
with the goal of making themselves more attractive as brides.  Sure no one talks
much of that in Harry Potter, but I think it is only because it *is* largely a
child's series, with little attention paid to marriage or the finding of a
spouse. The hints of this are there.  Lily Evens' magical prowess is referenced
over and over again, even by Hagrid[^210329-21] Neville comes from a good
family, but is belittled for a supposed lack of power.[^210329-22] [[Ginny]]'s
power is also remarked upon.[^210329-23]

That aside, if [[Molly|adults/Molly]] is going to teach [[Ginny]] to cook, is
she really going to teach her to do so entirely without magic?  Sure, [[Ginny]]
can peel potatoes, or chop vegetables, but we see [[Molly|adults/Molly]] making
some sort of cream sauce with her wand, as well as lighting the
stove.[^210329-24] Even if you suppose both silent casting like we see in book
six, and a form of casting that does not depend on precise wand movements, to
both turn on a gas stove and light it with a single poke? It seems more that
[[Molly|adults/Molly]] has a stove designed for wand-based operation.  If that
is true, [[Ginny]] would have to use her wand, or at least *a* wand, to learn to
cook on it.  While some families might have house elves, I think that the world
described is sufficiently traditional that most mothers would be teaching
daughters to cook, and thus an exception must exist.

### First-Generation "Immigrants"

I wrote quite the rant on the way they deal with [[first-generation witches and
wizards|Immigration]].

### Blood Status

I wrote an entire page on [[class and blood|Class_and_Blood]]. 

Beyond those notes, I think it really interesting when Mrs. Rowling states that
a [[Malfoy|Families/Malfoy]] ancestor argued against the ISWS, was active in
"high-born Muggle circles, and that much of the family wealth comes from the
non-magical world.[^210420-12]  This provides an additional potential motivation
for the dislike of the first generation "immigrants" and concordant emphasis on
blood status, the [[Malfoys|Families/Malfoy]], and families like them, may well
want the ISWS to fail.[^210420-13] They want the ISWS to fail not because they
like non-magicals, but because they dislike the restrictions on making money off
of the non-magicals. They may have successfully transitioned and found new
sources of wealth, but interacting with the muggle economy will always be, in a
sense, free money to those with the most ambition and the fewest moral scruples,
those willing to "use any means to achieve their ends."[^210420-14]

### Government

We know that there is a Council of Magical Law,[^210510-1] Wizengamot acting as
a High Court[^210329-1], an International Confederation of Wizards[^210329-2],
and a Ministry of Magic.[^210329-3] The relationship between these and the
powers of each is largely speculative, especially if you use only the seven
original books as a reference.

#### Separation from the Non-Magical World

We do not know precisely how or when the British magical society began to
separate from the non-magical world.  While the [International Statute of
Wizarding Secrecy][ISWS-1] is fairly precisely dated, the government that
ratified it on behalf of the British people is not. The popular theory is that,
for one reason or another, the ruling class among the wizards (which may or may
not have been a democratically elected body and thus all of them) convinced the
Crown to sign a treaty granting them some level of autonomy in exchange for
fealty and non-interference.  Stories like _Not Normal_[^210406-47], _A Military
Man_[^210406-48], and _Mutant Storm_[^210406-49] all fall into this  category,
though there are others.  Most seem to call this treaty "The Treaty of Kent"
though there seams to be no true basis for this name.  While most authors have
settled on that as a name, there is no similar consensus on a date for this
inferred treaty.  The one that makes the most sense to me is that from _Not
Normal_, that it came out of the unrest from the War of the Roses.[^210406-50]

If you go with this theory, while the two governments might have been split at
this time time, it was not in fact illegal for wizards to live among or do
business with non-wizards by virtue of this treaty, and would not be until the
ISWS came in the late 1600s.  However, with the advent of the ISWS, many things
that some wizards, like the [[Malfoys|Families/Malfoy]], had been doing for
years, suddenly became illegal.  This prompted the British wizards to revisit
their system of government and revamp it into the more centralised, more
organised, and (theoretically) more effective Ministry of Magic.  

This theory fits the available cannon sources.  If the two societies had not
*already* been largely split, then implementing the ISWS would not have been
practicable.  If the two societies had been already *effectively* split, then
the ISWS would not have been necessary.  British people being who and what they
are, and the ISWS being a "foreign" concept (IE not originated by them), they
would not have gone for it unless it solved a local need.  While there *was* an
up swing in witch hunts in the mid 1600s, it was never a particularly wide
spread or particularly effective practice in Britain.[^210406-51] 

On the other hand, suppose there were *already* two societies, even if some
members crossed over more than the ISWS would permit.  Further suppose, per the
Treaty of Kent (or whatever name) theory, there were *already* in place
mechanisms for dealing with land ownership, taxes, law enforcement, and
citizenship across the two societies.  For all its flaws, _Not Normal_ does a
fairly good job of world building a history of the separation for
example.[^210406-52] In that case, it would be a case of making those properties
secret, and the offices in charge of keeping them separate equally so.  That is
much more obtainable than implementing all of that in a vacuum to solve a threat
that largely does not exist, is already in decline to the extent it does exist,
and requires admitting that those who do not have magic are a threat to (and
thus not fully inferior to) those who do. 

Mrs. Rowling, on the Pottermore website (and thus the wizardingworld successor
site), devotes considerable energy to the supposed back story for the magical
community in the United States, and its relationship to the ISWS.[^210510-2] I
[[debunk|MACUSA]] that history elsewhere. For that reason I use the prequel
movies and the website articles as canonical only when convenient.

* The Minister for Magic is democratically elected.[^210330-6]

#### Wizengamot

* We know there are about 50 members at [[Harry]]'s trial,[^210329-4] when it sits
  in a "full criminal trial"[^210329-6] or in other words, "the full
  court."[^210329-7]
* We do not know if "the full court" is the same as "the full Wizengamot," it is
  possible that some subset is on a "Judicial Committee" or
  some-such.[^210329-8]  
* We know that, at least when sitting as a court, [[Mr. Weasley|adults/Arthur]]
  is not allowed in.[^210329-9]
* We know that, at least when sitting as a court, Mr. Malfoy is not allowed
  in.[^210329-10]
* It is strongly implied that the Malfoy family does in fact have a title from
  the Norman conquest.[^210330-2]
* We are told that a Potter "has twice sat on the Wizengamot"[^210330-1]
* Both of these have been at key times in Wizard/Non-Wizard
  relations.[^210517-14] This suggests that members may not be
  elected.[^210517-15]
* There exists a "British Youth Representative to the Wizengamot"[^210329-11]
* We know that the Wizengamot has a Charter of Rights.[^210329-5] This
  suggests, but does not prove, a legislative function. 
* Able to at least suggest that a Minister leave office.[^210330-9]

Any number of stories, including _[Not Normal][RNN1]_, which I have referenced
as an example of interesting world building time and time again, fall into the
trap of assuming that the Wizengamot is populated by those who either do or did
hold titles of nobility.  _[Not Normal][RNN2]_ attempts to reconcile how this
might work, but it ultimately fails the consistency check.  Disregarding Mrs.
Rowling's date for the [[Malfoy|Families/Malfoy]] family's introduction to England is
relatively minor, but you also have to rewrite the [[Potter|Families/Potter]]
and [[Black|Families]] histories.  You are essentially ignoring *all*
genealogical information not just from secondary canonical sources like
[Pottermore][], you are even ignoring some from the books.  If the Wizengamot is
based on noble titles, then [[Harry]]'s status as [[Sirius|adults|Sirius]]'
godson is insufficient to explain inheritance, [[Harry]] must also be
biologically related to the [[Blacks|Families]].  The problem is that there is
no Euphemia Black in the [[Black|Families]] tree, and no reasonable
[[Black|Families]] who might have married [[Henry
Potter|People/ppl/1/0/ed5a623f3fdb0cc0fb3a9d9f01/]].  

_["Great Scott, Potter, This is War!"][GSP1]_ on the other hand assumes that
membership is based on being an influential family back when our theoretical
treaty of separation was negotiated.[^211007-1]  To make this story work, the
author posited that while we may have *records* of the Potter family only as far
back of as [[Linfred the Potterer|People/ppl/e/9/ed65c4983c814d5df333de2729e/]],
the family itself is much older.[^211007-2]  The primary problems with this are
that it contradicts the origin story for the [[Potter|Families/Potter]]s and
possibly others, and that it gives the [[Malfoy|Families/Malfoy]] a seat in the
"Full Wizengamot" that, per the above, they do not seem to have.  A secondary
problem with this is that it seems to ignore the [[Peverell|Families/Peverell]]
family name, with the accompanying backstory for the Deathly Hallows.  Lastly,
it does not solve the problem of voting inheritance between the
[[Black|Families]] and [[Potter|Families/Potter]] families (though this might be
considered part of my statement that it contradicts the origin stories).

### Clothing

Mrs. Rowling insists that wizards wear robes.[^200723-4] The problem is that
she claims that this is because Wizarding fashion is intentionally frozen in the
17th century.  This is a problem because while academics, clerics, and scholars
wore robes in the 17th century, male fashion varied considerably for those in
other occupations.  This is very much part of era of doublets and
hose.[^200723-5] Sometimes guys wore "over-gowns" other decades they did not.
Sometimes the doublets were more or less "skirted."  Some decades codpieces were
in evidence.  For the Hogwarts uniform to be robe based is one thing, but
wizards seem to come from every strata of society.  It is highly unlikely that
they all view themselves as court scholars; surely some of them would have
preferred a more lordly self-image, others a more martial self-image.  The styles
of the century she cites allow for both.  She says that "Day to day, however,
even those who detest Muggles wear a version of Muggle clothing, which is
undeniably practical compared with robes."[^210420-11]  This makes sense, the
working classes and farming families would have wanted something more practical,
even if they did use magic in place of manual labour as much as possible and
even when somewhat unreasonable.  Still, who seriously wears robes with little
or nothing under them to do such classic Wizarding things like flying a broom
(Quidditch robes‽) or duelling?

The real question then is how the girls dress.  Magic allows for greater gender
equality, and the society described in the books *mostly* supports that, though
it hints that there may be some severe social limitations on married witches,
and what is "proper" versus what is "allowed."  Do the girls consistently wear
long dresses, or do they also adopt activity appropriate garb?  If only the
Quidditch players adopt activity appropriate garments, that might well be why
girls playing Quidditch is not "proper." 

Looking at Hogwarts, [[Ron]] asks [[Hermione]] to leave so that he and [[Harry]]
can change on the train in the first book,[^210525-8] the third book has no
mention of changing clothing, and while the fourth[^210525-9] and
fifth[^210525-10] books do, it is one line that just says it happens.  It is
almost as if they just pull on their robes over their clothing in the fourth and
fifth book, except that you would not use the word "change" for that.  It would
also contradict the scene from [[Snape's|adults/Snape]] memory where after being
flipped upside down, [[James|adults/James]] threatens to remove his
underwear.[^210525-11] In book six, Harry does _not_ change, and loses points
for his "muggle" clothing,[^210525-12] again refuting the movies and the many
fanfictions with school uniforms that are essentially standard non-magical
school uniforms with an open robe.

### Education and Research

Oxford was founded between 1096 and 1167, the University of Paris between 1160
and 1250, the University of Cambridge in 1209.[^210420-3] The magical culture
would no doubt remember the Museion in Alexandria that was founded between 367
BC and 246 BC,[^210420-4] and ran until the third century AD,[^210420-5]
even assuming they did not use magic to hide part of it from the non-magical
world and survive the destruction of the rest.  The culture would similarly be
aware of the Imperial University of Constantinople, running from 425 to sometime
in the 15th century.[^210420-6] Wikipedia also shows centres of learning in
the right time frame to influence the cultures that would have met in the ICW to
debate the Statute of Secrecy in India and China.[^210420-7]

This is compared to the magical world, that seems to have no institutes of
higher learning, education ends between age 17 and 18 depending on country.
Despite a world-wide population and a culture that values the long established
and traditional, there are only *eleven* prestigious schools
*worldwide.*[^210420-8]  She attributes this to a combination of wizarding
wars and non-magical persecution,[^210420-9] but I think more is necessary to
explain this.  I personally like the explanation given in RoseLilian's work _[The
difference a good solicitor makes][tdgsm-1]_.  

> Another issue is less reasonable but still relevant - wealth. The magical
> world is smaller than the muggle one, and our wealth is not in gems or metal,
> but in enchanted objects and hoarded knowledge. Muggleborns, who do not have
> such wealth passed down to them from their ancestors, have long used the money
> they brought in from the muggle world to buy knowledge and objects and then
> either shared it, making it nearly worthless in an economic sense or had it
> destroyed due to it being dangerous.[^210420-10]

She describes this view as being a Slytherin one, not necessarily one held by
all, or even most, of the wizarding world.  Elsewhere I speculate that the
wizarding culture radically changed with the ISWS, and that isolationism and the
ideas of blood status started to gain a prominence that they had not previously
held.  Even assuming that is true, wizards were *already* showing a marked
difference from their non-magical neighbours in the realm of education and
research.  As I highlight above, the non-magical world was centralising
knowledge and pushing scholarship.  The lack of university course work, the idea
that your education is *complete* at age 17, shows a radically different view in
the magical world.  Thus I believe that while this view may not be universal,
and that Ravenclaws in particular may dislike the view, that it is a common one.  

This view would have the happy accident of explaining why in the cannon books it
would not occur to the [[Weasleys|Families/Weasley]] to step in and ensure that
[[Harry]] and [[Hermione]] know and understand more about the world and culture
they are stepping into, leaving so many holes in our view and understanding of
that culture.  A culture of knowledge hoarding and secrecy would mean that even
well meaning people like the [[Weasleys|Families/Weasley]] would have an
unconscious taboo surrounding actually teaching those outside the family
anything not taught at school.

### Parchment and Quills

I think the use of parchment and quills is a an example of Wizarding culture
being deliberately antiquarian.  There may also be an element of exclusivity -
it takes practice to use a quill with any degree of skill that pure-blood
children will have but that first generation children will utterly lack.  There
may also be a sense of exclusivity in a second sense, parchment is *expensive*
and the extensive use of parchment even stupid little notes and homework
assignments will help keep poor families away from magical knowledge.  If you
cannot afford parchment, your children cannot do as well at Hogwarts, and thus
cannot do as well in later life. This came to me when I was reading a fanfiction
that talked about not just [[Harry]] using a fountain pen, but that many pure-blood
wives "secretly" did the same for their (extensive) correspondence.[^200816-3]
For whatever reason, it occurred to me to look up the steel nibbed dip pens that
predated fountain pens, wondering when in non-magical (actual) history pens
started to replace the use of quills.  I was really quite surprised.  Apparently
pens go *way* back, the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org) was very
Britain centric (which is actually fine for my purposes), but apparently our
earliest pen (a copper one) dates from around 410, just as the Romans were
pulling out of Britain.[^200816-4] It does not come out and state it, but my
guess is that for a long time fine metal work was *really* expensive, so quills
remain the standard writing utensil until the mass production of steel pens in
1822.[^200816-5]  Interestingly, according to the article, these type of pens
are still favoured over fountain pens for calligraphy and other artistic works
that require precision and varied thicknesses.[^200816-6]  

From this I can draw a couple of conclusions.  Magical users would dislike
fountain pens, because they seem drawn to multi-coloured inks (which are more
difficult with fountain pens), and because arts like ancient runes would need
much the same precision that writing calligraphy does.  The dip pen on the other
hand, should show no marked difference from a quill for writing your runes.
Both would be substandard to a brush - there is a reason that Chinese and
Japanese languages are painted, not written when you look at the really fancy
stuff. The dip pen could further be *engraved* with runes.  In the books you see
spell correcting quills, and others with anti-cheating charms.  I can see both
of these being done more reliably with runes.  You want a dicto-quill?  Again,
you can see how this can be reproduced.  

Moreover, magical users are clearly drawn to the aesthetic quality of a fancy
feather.  Fountain pens *can* be artistic, but are generally fairly utilitarian.
Your dip pen on the other hand could be a work of art.  I did a quick Google
search on "steel nib feather" for example, and you can just imagine a wizard
using many of those. 

Paper and parchment is a bit more uncertain.  Paper is *really* old, perhaps as
far back as 300 B.C. in China.[^200816-7]  However, it took a while for paper
to reach Europe, sometime around the 11th Century.[^200816-8]  Paper was
originally viewed with disdain, unworthy for formal communication, or important
works[^200816-9]; something that would definitely influence the magically
community.  However, it seems that by the 16th Century or so, paper had largely
replaced parchment, driven largely by the printing press.[^200816-10] The
Wizarding world does seem to have a sufficient trade in books to stock at least
two book stores (one in Hogsmeade and one in Diagon Alley), and I am quite
confident that the books give us a view of the press that the Quibbler is
printed on.  This means that they do use paper books, and paper periodicals.

Any number of fanfiction works I've read have speculated that there might be a
magical reason for using parchment instead of paper.  Most of these have not
really made much sense given the above.  However one I came across recently
does.  

> Paper doesn’t take magic terribly well: parchment is a single piece of
animal skin, a unitary object. Paper is laid fibre from multiple trees, a
composite object and as such tricky to get predictable results out of when you
enchant it. The more you know, et cetera.[^200819-1]

The reference is to some of the fragmentary descriptions we have from
[[McGonagall|adults/McGonagall]]'s lectures on transfiguration.  You have to be
able to visualise the object that you are working your magic on.  In this light
it is actually easier to see why it might be troublesome to enchant paper.  It
would be all too easy to have a charm take hold on only a subset of the fibres
involved, and thus behave erratically across the document.  This makes a strong
argument for using parchment (or vellum) for documents that are *actually
magical in nature* (like contracts, tests charmed against cheating, official
government or banking forms, etc), but not for standard every day things (like
homework, class notes, and letters (unless you are including privacy charms)).  

You would then want writing utensils that work equally well on both, but while
I can't speak to how a fountain pen or ball point pen might work on parchment, a
quill or dip pen should both work equally well on any decent quality paper.
