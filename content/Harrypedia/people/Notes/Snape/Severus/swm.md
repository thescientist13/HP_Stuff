Any attempt to understand [Sirius][], [Lily][], [James][], [Snape][], the
relationships (both positive and negative) between them, and yes, even to some
extent even [McGonagall][] and [Dumbledore][] ends up pivoting on the events at
the end of the 1975-1976 school year when [Lily][], [James][] and their friends
(or enemies as the case may be) were in their fifth year. We do not know the
exact chronology, what follows is my best reconstruction. 

[Sirius]: <{{< relref "Sirius_III" >}}>

[James]: <{{< relref "James" >}}>

[Lily]: <{{< relref "Lily_J." >}}> 

[Snape]: <{{< relref "Severus" >}}>

[Severus]: <{{< relref "Severus" >}}>

[McGonagall]: <{{< relref "Minerva" >}}>

[Dumbledore]: <{{< relref "Albus_Percival_Wulfric_Brian" >}}>

[Lupin]: <{{< relref "Remus_John" >}}>

## What Happened

My first instinct is to quote it, the first scene is most of page 278 in the
American Kindle Edition, the second scene has key details from kindle location
9426-9519 in the American Edition of the *fifth* book (it is skimmed over in the
seventh, though we are told Harry re-watches it), and the third scene takes up a
chunk of page 279 back in _Deathly Hallows_.  Overall there is just way too much
of Mrs. Rowling's copyrighted text for me to feel comfortable even block quoting
it.  So I will summarise what we know.  From these two books:

### Evidence from The Shrieking Shack[^210921-5]
* “Severus was very interested in where I went every month,” 
* [Lupin][] says that [Sirius][] alone is responsible
  for telling [Snape][] to go into the tunnel, and how.
* Per [Lupin][], [James][] found out only later what
  [Sirius][] had done. 
* Per [Lupin][], [Snape][] believed that [James][] and [Lupin][] were in on
  [Sirius][]' actions.
* [Snape][] confirms that belief as he reveals himself from under
  the invisibility cloak.

### Snape in the Hospital Wing 

Immediately following the events in the Shrieking Shack:

> “Sirius Black showed he was capable of murder at the age of sixteen,” he
> breathed. “You haven’t forgotten that, Headmaster? You haven’t forgotten that
> he once tried to kill *me*?”[^210921-6]

The above quote is almost trivial, it is hard to blame [Snape][] for disliking
someone who tried to kill him after all.  The reason I bring it up is that
[Snape][] of all people must know that things are not always as they seem - his
entire life since the prophesy has been subterfuge.  He of all people must
understand the value of forgiveness and second chances - if [Dumbledore][] was
not willing to give [Snape][] a chance, then he would not be there to complain.
And yet, he is not willing to allow for either in the case of those who have
wronged him.

### First relevant memory from Snape[^210921-7]

* [Lily][] and [Snape][] are an unknown amount older than when they were
  sorted.  We *infer* that this is fifth year. 
* Mulciber has tried to do something to Mary Macdonald "the other day" that
  [Lily][] considers proof-positive that Mulciber is "creepy."
  Whatever he tried to do involved [[Dark Magic|Magic]].  
* [Snape][] dismisses [Lily][]'s concerns saying that Mulciber's actions are
  funny. 
* When dismissing her concerns does not work, [Snape][] tries to redirect the
  conversation to the failings of [James][] and company.  
* [Snape][] immediately focuses in on [Lupin][]'s status as a werewolf. 
* [Lily][] turns cold when responding.  My inference is that [Lily][] disagrees
  with [Snape][]'s bias against werewolves.  I am unsure if [Lily][] is truly
  ignorant of [Lupin][]'s status, or if she is pretending to be.  It probably
  does not matter which. 
* [Lily][] blushes under [Snape][]'s "intense" gaze.  More is going on in this
  conversation than the surface words.  I am not incredible at this people
  reading thing.  Is Lily reacting to [Snape][] being attracted to her, or is
  [Lily][] reacting to the fact that she *is* attracted to [James][] and
  [Snape][] has accurately called her on the fact?
* [Lily][] defends [James][] and Co saying "They don't use Dark Magic."  
* [Lily][] calls [Snape][] ungrateful, because [James][] saved [Snape][]'s
  life.
* [Snape][] claims that [James][] was saving himself, that saving [Snape][] was
  essentially a selfish act. 
* Once [Lily][] states that [James][] is "an arrogant toerag," [Snape][] stops
  listening to anything she says.  

### Snape's second relevant memory, Order of the Phoenix version[^210921-8]

* It is the Defence Against the Dark Arts OWL written exam.
* [James][] and [Snape][] (minimally) *leave the exam with the exam question
  paper.*  
* [James][] and [Lupin][] are talking very openly about [Lupin][]'s status as a
  werewolf, yet [Lupin][] after himself saying "His name's Remus Lupin" as a
  joke answer to "signs that identify a werewolf" tells [James][] to keep his
  voice down two lines later.  
* They settle outside under a tree, and [Snape][] *just happens* to settle down
  within hearing distance of his worst enemies. 
* [James][] is showing off with a snitch, well aware that there are girls in
  the area (even if they are not watching, they might see him).  
* [Sirius][] is bored.
* [Sirius][] claims he does not need to consult a book to quiz [Lupin][].
* [James][] spots [Snape][], who is about to leave the area. 
* "Snape reacted so fast it was as though he had been expecting an attack"
* [James][] is faster. He uses two fairly harmless spells.  He's still watching to see the girls' reaction.  
* [James][] uses a spell to wash [Snape][]'s mouth out for bad language.  This is undoubtedly fairly cruel. 
* [Lily][] to the rescue.
* [Lily][] is very cold at first towards [James][]
* [Snape][] fires off something that draws blood.
* [James][] reacts with a spell that leaves [Snape][] hanging upside down with
  his underwear on display.  The humiliation is no doubt worse because the
  spell used is one [Snape][] invented.
* [Lily][]'s face twitches.  I think perhaps she considers this fair
  retribution for a spell that draws blood. She's hiding that fact from
  [James][] though. 
* [Lily][] insists that [James][] and [Sirius][] end the torment.
* [Snape][] calls [Lily][] a Mudblood.
* [Lily][] turns cold towards [Snape][] and calls him "Snivellus" for the first
  time, knowing that will hurt him.
* [Lily][] says that [James][] is as bad as [Snape][]. Her reasoning is partly
  that he tries to make himself look cool, and partly that he hexes people just
  because he can.  
* [Sirius][] interprets [Lily][]'s comments as essentially boiling down to
  [James][] being arrogant.  
* [James][] returns to tormenting [Snape][] when [Lily][] storms off.

### Snape's Third Relevant Memory[^210921-9]

* [Snape][] apologies.
* [Lily][] refuses to hear it. 
* [Snape][] says he did not mean to call her Mudblood.
* [Lily][] calls him out for his friends who all want to be Death Eaters.  She
  further claims that [Snape][] wants to be one. 
* [Snape][] opens his mouth to deny this, but then closes it without saying
  anything. 
* [Snape][] again tries to protest he did not mean to call her names.
* [Lily][] is having none of it, because he calls other people by the same
  names.
* [Snape][] has no response. 

## What does this mean

### Looking at the events themselves

I do not doubt that [James][] was in fact fairly arrogant, and that was a
barrier to any friendship between himself and [Lily][].  That being said, I do
*not* think that [Lily][] disliked him as much as it sounds.  I am not the best
at reading people, but I think [Harry][] is worse, and, unfortunately,
everything we know is filtered through his perceptions (or in this case lack
thereof).  [Snape][] is inordinately focused on making sure that [Lily][] sees
[James][] in a bad light.  *Some* of that is because *[Snap][]* is aware that
[James][] is a rival for her affections.  

There are, however, only two real possibilities here.  

1. [Snape][] is irrationally jealous of the mere *possibility* that [Lily][]
   *might* like [James][] merely because he \([James][]\) is popular.
   [Snape][] is so irrational about [Lily][] that he actually undermines his
   own position to reassure himself on this point. 
1. To bastardise an overused quote, [Lily][] doth protest too much.  In other
   words, she *does* show signs of being attracted to [James][], and [Snape][],
   being both jealous and perceptive, picks up on these signs.  He does not
   know how to deal with the fact, and undermines his own position trying to
   undo something he sees going on. 

[Snape][] *is* ungrateful, though if he *truly* believes that [James][] was
motivated by selfishness, *then and only then* is that attitude justified.
Assume [Lupin][]'s account is accurate - [James][] neither knew about nor
condoned [Sirius][]' extremely poor idea of a "joke."  [James][] then himself
risked the fully grown werewolf to save [Snape][].  There are a couple of
possibilities:

1. It has been suggested that [Snape][] had been speculating that [Lupin][] was
   a werewolf for some time prior to the incident.  Not only that, but that
   [Sirius][] was aware that [Snape][] had so speculated.  If this is true,
   [Snape][] went down into that tunnel to investigate a suspected werewolf on
   the night of a full moon, then blames [James][] and [Sirius][] for the fact
   that he \([Snape][]\) found *precisely what he expected*.[^210921-10]  If
   this is true, then [Snape][] is both a hypocrite and insanely stupid.  It
   is, however, a *cunning* plan.
1. [Snape][] had no clue what to expect.  He did, however, know that [Sirius][]
   hates him.  He broke school rules because [Sirius][], who hates him, gave
   him a clue on how to get [Sirius][]' friend in trouble.  Because that does
   not sound at all like a trap.  Whether or not you believe that [James][] was
   in on it, [Snape][]'s behaviour is still insanely stupid.  Honestly though,
   we have no reason other than [Snape][]'s irrational hatred to doubt
   [James][] innocence.  

Given that in the first memory, Lily dismisses [Snape][]'s werewolf theory as
essentially old well worn ground, I believe that the first possibility is more
likely.  Thus [Snape][] *intended* to find a werewolf, but did not intended to
either be saved, nor *need* saving.  He underestimated the danger involved in a
werewolf encounter, overestimated the controls on [Lupin][] escaping restraint,
or both.  [Snape][] *intended* to be a hero, exposing a danger to the school at
great personal risk.  This cunning plan was spoiled by three things.  Firstly,
in that, as I said, he underestimated the danger and required rescue.
Secondly, because that rescuer was his own nemisis, and (according to [Snape])
in on the whole thing anyway.  Thirdly, because [Dumbledore][] insisted on
keeping the whole matter quiet, and prevented [Snape][] from actually exposing
[Lupin][]. [Snape][] resents the fact that he is denied his moment of glory,
and is trying to find ways to ensure that the secret he has promised to keep
gets out.  

Sure, [James][] hates [Snape][] and vice versa.  I doubt the event would have
changed things even if both were reasonable rational and mature real-world
adults (if such a thing exists).  In such a case, however, we would expect
[Snape][] to give credit where credit is due, and would call him on it when he
fails to do so.  In other words, the rational, reasonable thing is to criticise
[Snape][] for *blaming* [James][] for the incident.  

We do not know what happened to Mary Macdonald, but [Lily][] insists that it is
[[Dark Magic|Magic]] and *Evil* (her emphasis).  Somehow that is *funny* but
[James][]' actions are unforgivable.  Even if I entirely agreed with
[Snape][]'s reading of events, I see only a difference in target.  Since I
*don't* agree with [Snape][]'s reading, I see that any offence against
[Snape][] is unforgivable, but *anything* [Snape][], or by extension his
friends, does is justifiable.  We call such a person a hypocrite, and generally
look down on him or her.  This is, however, classic villain behaviour. 

### Looking at the memories

I have some questions about the memories, in both books.

#### The presentation

Unfortunately our most detailed account of these events comes from the memories
that [Snape][], a master [Occlumens][].  We know that when Slughorn tried to
modify a memory to give to [Dumbledore][], the result was painfully obvious in
a pensieve.[^210921-1]  What we do not know is if it was obvious *because it
was modified* or if it was obvious *because the modification was crudely
done.*[^210921-2]  Thus we do not know if it is possible that [Snape][]
modified these memories or not; we do not know how reliable a witness these
memories represent.[^210921-3] 

The second memory, the one with the most discrepancies (see below), has some
partial validation in that neither [Sirius][] nor [Lupin][] deny what happened,
on the other hand, [Harry][] only describes what he saw, they did not see the
memory themselves.  If [Snape][] was smart enough to craft his lies on versions
of the truth, if he distorted true memories rather than than inventing things
out of whole cloth, [Harry][] may not have included the details that would
allow either listener to notice the discrepancies.  

#### The content

There are a few details that raise red flags.  Unfortunately, some of them *may*
be a cultural thing, the difference between American schools and British ones.  

The first is, as I note above, that the students take the exam paper with them
when they leave the OWL exam.  Based on my experience of standardised exams,
this seems incredibly odd.  I know that all of the *[Hogwarts][]* students take
the OWLS at the same time, but we also know that not everyone goes to
[Hogwarts][].  As corrupt as that culture is, surely the Wizarding Examinations
Authority has had to deal with people buying copies of a test before.
Controlling access to the exact exam questions used should carry over to the
magical world as well. 

Second, as everyone is leaving the exam, we overhear [James][], [Lupin][],
Pettigrew and [Sirius][] talking.  Keep in mind two things, this is
*[Snape][]'s* memory.  He was close enough to at least subconsciously hear
them. The book attempts to account for this by saying that [Harry][] has to
strain to hear them, but, the passage describes a "gang" of girls as having
just left the boys' group, and then, when they start picking on [Snape][], we
see that a number of students are able to quickly gather.  Why are they
discussing [Lupin][]'s status so openly at all?  Why does *[Lupin][]* joke
about answering that question in that way?  We see no indication of what volume
most of the comments were said at, but it is still very odd that so much was
said before [Lupin][] became uncomfortable. 

Third, [Snape][] settles down in fairly close range to [James][] and [Sirius][]
*at all.*  If this were anything other than a necessary plot device in fiction,
this right here would be the single strongest indicator that the memories are
fabricated.  As someone who has had trouble with school yard bullies, you
simply do *not* relax around them.  [Snape][] would have picked *anywhere* else
on the grounds.  He would have *stayed inside* rather than willingly putting
himself at risk that way.  

On a side note, in his work _[Toxic][]_, WitandAmbition makes very similar
points, but focuses more on [Lily][] and [Snape][] starting further back in
time to paint much the same picture.

[^210921-10]: I was not the first to think of this. Cite others if I refind
    them. 

[^210921-3]: Some have speculated that pensieves rely on time magic.  Mrs.
    Rowling, writing on the [Pottermore][RPM1] site, says it relies on not just
    conscious recall, but "every detail stored in the
    subconscious."[^210921-4]

### Looking at the Fall-out

#### Lily and Snape

Some writers blame [Lily][] for the fact that [Snape][] became a Death Eater,
pointing to this incident.  If she had forgiven him, her friendship would have
given him the strength he needed to resist [Riddle][]'s temptations.  I
honestly disagree, and point to the first of [Snape][]'s memories as my proof.
If she had forgiven him, he would have remained in denial about the evil nature
of the actions that Mulciber and his \([Snape][]'s\) other Death Eater friends
were committing.  This would inevitably lead to facing the same temptations to
joining [Riddle][].  [Snape][] would then have rationalised things saying that
by joining [Riddle][], he would be in a *better* position to protect [Lily][].
He would figure that [Riddle][] would spare a Death Eater's family even if she
was a mudblood.  This would draw [Snape][] deeper and deeper into [Riddle][]'s
atrocities and soul corrupting influence.  You simply cannot be around such
people without their evil rubbing off on you.  

[Riddle]: <{{< relref "Tom_Marvolo" >}}> 

People criticising [Lily][] are essentially pushing her towards missionary
dating.  It is not *precisely* the same situation, but it is close enough.
Sure you can find anecdotal evidence that missionary dating works, but in
general, it is a bad idea.[^211220-2]

Secondly, I remain unconvinced that [Lily][] was romantically inclined towards
[Snape][] at all.  Certainly both [Snape][] and [James][] were both
romantically interested in *her*, both aware of the other's interest in her,
and both jealous of the other's perceived advantages.  It does not follow that
just because [Lily][] was *friends* with someone who wanted that friendship to
be more, that *she* **also** wanted that friendship to be more.  

Lastly, {{< wikipedia "Alan Rickman" >}} may be attractive (at least, I am
told he is).  He is not however, the definitive rendition of [Severus
Snape][Snape].  Lets not read more into the text than is actually there just
because you actually like the *actor* as opposed to the *character*.

    the subject.

#### Lily and James

Certainly this event clears the way for Lily to begin dating James.  Earlier I
speculated that there are two possibilities.  Either she is embarrassed about
being unable to return [[Snape|adults/Snape]]'s feelings, or she is embarrassed
about being called upon her own feelings for [[James|adults/James]].  If the
latter, I would have expected [[Lily|adults/Lily]] and [[James|adults/James]] to
get together during their sixth year.  We are told they did not do so until
seventh year.  

A third possibility is that it is some combination of *both* of the above
scenarios.  If [[Lily|adults/Lily]] is attracted to but conflicted about
[[James|adults/James]] then we have a rational story towards their relationship
during seventh year.  Instead of a miraculous about face where she goes from
hating him to head over heels in love, she has gradually watched him mature over
sixth year, and finally become the man she has been pushing him to be as he
embraces responsibility as Head Boy in seventh year.  In a sense, this is
exactly my point about missionary dating.  [[Lily|adults/Lily]] agrees to date
[[James|adults/James]] only after the man she has been attracted to all along
makes that change to become someone she can see herself marrying *on his own*,
**before she begins their relationship**.  Only then does she allow herself to
act on that attraction by agreeing to go out with him.
