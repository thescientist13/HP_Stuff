Unlike the [Longbottom][] family, there is a slight indication that the Malfoy
family might actually be ennobled.  While I see no indication of it in the
books, Mrs. Rowling's Pottermore writings talk about them getting a "prime
piece of land" for services to the King,[^210330-3] something that probably
came with a title.  Since they apparently continued (per the same page) to be
high class socialites through the passage of the Statute of Secrecy,[^210330-4]
it seems unlikely that they lost that title in the various periods of civil
unrest between the Norman conquest and the Statute's division of society into
magical and non-magical cultures.  They seem to have been influential with
government leaders, but not actually part of the magical government, ever
since.[^210330-5]

On a side note, "Malfoy" is essentially "Bad faith" in French.  I highly doubt
that Mrs. Rowling intended this to have any real meaning except foreshadowing
the role that the family would play.  It would, however, be incredibly fun if
it *did* have meaning.  In a world where [Astoria Greengrass][Astoria] can have
a hereditary curse,[^210421-1] this should certainly be possible.  Considering
that French was a fairly well known language in the upper classes, I cannot
imagine that the name "Bad faith" did the Malfoy family any good mixing with
the upper crust of either society.  Sure they may have kept it out of stubborn
pride, but it is much more fun to imagine they had no choice but to keep the
name.[^210421-2]

Interestingly, based on the timelines I can piece together, Abraxus Malfoy
should have been alive for most if not all of the first war.[^210816-1] At
least, I can find no indication that he himself was a known death
eater,[^210816-2] or that he died before [Lucius][] graduated
school.[^210816-3]  This overlap is probably the reason why some authors have
chosen to state that [Lucius][] may have inherited the relationship with
[Riddle][] rather than having fostered it.

[^210816-3]: I cannot exactly document a negative for this one.

    It says *his son* was notorious.  If Abraxus had died in a raid, or gone to
    trial at all, or even been arrested and let off, I think it would say he was
    notorious.

[^210421-1]: As best I can tell, [Astoria][]'s illness comes from the abominable
    play that was written as a sequel to the books.  I refuse to actually
    consider that cannon, but am using it here to highlight that my fiction is
    inherently compatible with Mrs. Rowling's creations.
