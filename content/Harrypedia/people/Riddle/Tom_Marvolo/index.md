## Problems

* the timeline above has a hole in it.  25 years separates our two fixed dates
  of finishing Hogwarts and the start of the war.
  * How long was Riddle at Borgin and Burke's?  I cannot imagine it was more
    than a 2-3 years on the outside.
  * How long between the interview for the Defence job and the start of the war?
    Even if we are generous with his time at the shop, we have at least ten
    years *after* the interview to account for.
* When does Lucius Malfoy take the mark? Before or after his graduation? Before
  or after his father dies? As the first Malfoy to do so, or the second? Note
  that his graduation would be after the start of the war.[^20210827-11]
