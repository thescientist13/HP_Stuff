Cannon Chapter Eight introduces the teachers, and the robbery.  Cannon Chapter
Nine has Draco, Hermione, the fake duel, and the Cerberus.  Here we are going AU
fairly strongly again.  Because Harry fled the Hall, our introduction to the
teachers is not their teaching style, but their glimpses of Harry.  Our
introduction to the students is not shaped by Ron, but rather Hannah (who would
someday in the Cannon universe become a prefect) becomes concerned for their
missing year-mate and convinces Susan to help her look for him.  The Cerberus
remains undiscovered, and Harry never learns of the robbery attempt.  Draco has
no reason to challenge Harry to a fake duel.
