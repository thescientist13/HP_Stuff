    * Comments: Ginny, Ron, and Hermione are allowed to see key scenes from
      Harry's past. But are these just visions, or can they change the future?
      This story departs from much of what happened in books six and seven. It
      assumes that Dumbledore and his allies *did* train Harry, secretly, and
      that training was just as brutal and inhumane, in its own way, as his
      early life. Unlike the epilogue of the real book seven, this story shows a
      real relationship between Harry and Ginny, and realistically named
      children result.

    * Comments: Harry spends a few days as a student in his parents' seventh
      year just after wining the canonical battle.  He reveals very little while
      he is back there, but is responsible for encouraging
      [Lily]({{< ref "Harrypedia/people/Evans/Lily" >}}) to reevaluate her
      relationships, and [Dumbledore]({{< ref "Harrypedia/people/Dumbledore/Albus" >}}) 
      to trust the prophesy.

    * Comments: Ron dies in Gringotts, Ginny and Hermione in the battle of
      Hogwarts.  Harry has to flee after retrieving the Diadem but before
      obtaining the means to destroy it.  He eventually learns everything he
      needs to win, but England is gone.  He goes back and time, quite insane.
      The Sorting Hat reluctantly allows him to change future history.
