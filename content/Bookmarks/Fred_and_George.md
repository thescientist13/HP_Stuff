These stories that are really about Fred and George, more than they are about Harry himself.

   * Comments: It is [Chapter 12. Ickle
     Ronnikins](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/12) that caused me to
     bookmark this one, though other chapters are worth mentioning.  This is a
     truly dark look at certain canon events from Ron's childhood culminating
     in an alternate ending.
