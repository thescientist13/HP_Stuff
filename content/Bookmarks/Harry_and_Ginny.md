While [Ginny]({{< ref "Harrypedia/people/Weasley/Ginevra_Molly" >}}) has flaws,
I remain partial to this pairing.  Unfortunately fan fiction rarely does it
justice.  

_[A Godfather's Love](https://archiveofourown.org/works/18216887)_

   * Comments: This story features Harry and Ginny, but is *really* about the
     failings of Dumbledore and Lupin.  What would have happened if Sirius had
     not seen the newspaper from Fudge, but rather died when Riddle raided
     Azkaban?  

_[Harry Potter and the Dimensional Trunk](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2456938)_
:   * Author: Ophiuchus
    * Published: 2005-06-27. Updated: 2005-08-07. 
    * Comments: This story ignores the concept of [[Horcruxes|Notes/Horcruxes]],
      and all the messiness that goes with them.  It focuses in the locked room
      in the Department of Mysteries, the idea of multi-compartment, multi-room
      trunks, and magical animagus transformations.  I rarely like Harry as a
      phoenix, but this story handles it reasonably well.  What I *really* like
      is the trunks.

_[Hope for the Best, Plan for the Worst](https://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=130020)_
:   * Author: Just Horsing Around
    * Published: 2015-10-09. Updated: 2015-10-19.
    * Comments: This story pre-dates [Ginny]({{< ref "Harrypedia/people/Weasley/Ginevra_Molly" >}})'s 
      confidence around [Harry]({{< ref "Harrypedia/people/Potter/Harry_James" >}}) 
      to his time in [Grimmauld Place]({{< ref "Harrypedia/Grimmauld_Place" >}}) 
      rather than the slower and mostly off "screen" build-up that we see in
      the canonical story line.  Here Ginny convinces and helps Harry to
      prepare for his trial rather than rely on [Dumbledore]({{< ref "Harrypedia/people/Dumbledore/Albus" >}}).  
      This turns out to be for the best, as [Lucius]({{< ref "Harrypedia/people/Malfoy/Lucius_Abraxus" >}}) 
      is rather more openly active in this version.  It is unfortunate that the
      author did not develop this concept further.

_[Walk Away Without Noticing](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/14040641/5/Walk-Away-Without-Noticing)_

    * Comments: This is one of the stories where Harry sends his memories back
      in time.  Unlike most, this Harry decides that he is best off using his
      memories to *not be noticed at all.*  A truly interesting twist.

_[The Harder Struggle](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8326015)_
:   * Author: Ericfmc
    * Published: 2012-07-16. Updated: 2012-12-19.
    * Comments: This really focuses more on Ron and Hermione than it does on
      Harry and Ginny, and is one of the stories that, while sticking with
      canonical couples, leans towards Hermione as world saviour and Harry as
      *her* side-kick.  Fortunately it only leans that way.  Still, I would
      prefer a stronger Ginny. 

_[Harry Potter and Godric's Legacy](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5270746)_
:   * Author: hermyd
    * Published: 2009-08-02. Updated: 2010-09-07. 
    * Comments: Featuring a Manipulative but not evil Dumbledore, and a
      redeemable Snape, this one is a super-powered Harry story with a bit of a
      twist.  There is a bit of a bond in this one, but it is very under-stated.

_[A Romance In Reverse](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12413357)_
:   * Author: DukeBrymin
    * Published: 2017-03-20
    * Comments: I have always wished that the author had chosen to expand this
      one out into a full universe setting, rather than a one-shot.  It written
      in reverse, even once you have read it all several times and understand it
      fully, it is delightful.  The premise is that Harry and Ginny have met
      before, and so when Harry meets Ron on the train, Ron stalks off in a huff
      because he resents being viewed as Ginny's brother (he wants to stand out
      remember).  This leaves Harry feeling very alone, so his wish at the
      Sorting is for a friend, and thus Hufflepuff.... and it all flows from
      there.
