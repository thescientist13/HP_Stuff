    * Comments: Chapter 3 has an interesting idea of the students not caring
      about the house cup after 5 years of Slytherin wins.  Because of its
      one-shot per chapter nature, this story could end up in any number of
      categories.  Chapter 20 is also interesting because of its perspective on
      the Line Continuation Act, which I have seen in other works.
