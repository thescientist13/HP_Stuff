These stories are primarily notable in that [Harry][] leaves Britain, the
magical world, or both. 

_[Good Bye, Farewell, So Long …](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/14124126)_ (title redacted)

    * Comments: This is primarily noteworthy for a couple reasons
      * You rarely see [Professor Sprout][] get called out for her behavior in book four.
      * This is the second work I have seen with {{< wikipedia "Baron Samedi" >}}.  The idea of using evil against evil is milding interesting.
      * The idea that the tournament means that [Harry][] is an adult is used as a plot device.

_[The Sniper](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3918135)_
:   * Author: DobbyElfLord
    * Published: 2007-11-28
    * Comments: This story leaves the question of [Horcruxes][] in an ambiguous
      state.  It is surprisingly complete picture of [Harry][] for such a short
      one-shot, but at the expense of any real epilogue to give a sense of
      closure.  There are a number of things I like in this that are mentioned
      but not fully explored.  The author did write a sequel, but it is not
      nearly as interesting.
      * [Harry][] realises that many of his problems are self caused in one
	sense, but the root cause is the effectively random oscillation between
	expecting him to handle things as an adult (which he isn't yet) and
	totally consign responsibilities over *to* the adults (despite the fact
	that he can see they are failing at handling things).  I experienced
	this oscillation myself growing up, and it *does* make responding
	correctly very difficult.  As a parent now, I also see the other side,
	how difficult it is to *not* do this to children.
      * [Harry][] realises, looking back, that part of the separation from his
	friends was his own fault.  We do not however, see more than hints of
	the *outcome* of this realisation.  
      * This story lets [Harry][] be an unusually strong wizard (most people
	cannot do nearly the wandless magic he can) without being overpowered
	(despite his prowess, without a wand he is still too weak to matter in
	a straight up magical fight).  In other words, we can see him as the
	one marked by the "Dark Lord" as "his equal."  I've argued that you
	cannot really do that even in the actual canonical books.
