title: Harry and Gabrielle
description: HP stories with Harry and Gabrielle paired
author: "Luke Schierer"

This pairing has to be *very* carefully handled to not simply come across as
creepy.  While no one blinks at a five year age gap between people in their
thirties, even a two year age gap will get a second look when dealing with high
school students.  While we do not know how old [Gabrielle][] is with any true
certainty, it is safe to say that she is way too young for fourteen year old
[Harry][] when they first meet.

    <dd>Comments: This story handles the age gap in two ways:<ul>
            <li>They do not get together until some time has passed,</li>
            <li>The gap is a problem for [Harry][],</li></ul> but magic is
        not always kind, nor always able to be undone.</dd>

    <dd>Comments: This handles the age gap because, through no fault of either
        party, [Harry][] has been in magical stasis for sufficient time that
        there no longer *is* an age gap.</dd>
