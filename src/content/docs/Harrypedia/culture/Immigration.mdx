title: "First-Generation “Immigrants”" 
author: "Luke Schierer"

Assuming that there *are* real differences between the culture dominating
magical Britain and non-magical Britain, some authors express frustration with
first generation magical users like [Hermione] who come into this new world
essentially as immigrants, and yet make no effort to learn about their new
society before both making value judgements and demanding that everyone change
to conform to the non-magical value system and culture.[^210220-2] Per this
view, it is the responsibility of the first generation magical user to learn
about the magical culture just like it would be my responsibility to learn about
French culture should I move to France. Just as France and french citizens would
have no special obligation to me, the magical world has no special obligation to
these first generation magic users.  

On the face of it, there is some merit to this argument; it is persuasive, seems
consistent, and certainly puts the first generation magical user on the
defensive.  This argument has, however, some significant flaws.  Both [Harry] and
[Hermione] chose to attend [Hogwarts], but neither were given full information.
Would [Hermione] have chosen to immigrate to a society where she would be a third
class citizen?  Even if she would have, would her parents have allowed such a
decision?  

Rowling does not tell us what happens to a muggleborn child who does not choose
to accept the invitation to [Hogwarts], but the common speculation falls into two
camps.  Either the child is simply not allowed to decline, or the child's
magical ability is "bound" or "suppressed" in some way, and the knowledge of
magic removed with spells such as obliviate.  Assuming that either of these is
true, then the analogy to immigration utterly falls down.  The first generation
witch or wizard has been forced to enter this society, at "wand point." If you
force me to join your society, then you *do* bear some responsibility for
teaching me to succeed in it.  

The common defence of forcing first-generation magicals to join the new society
is the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy(ISWS).  The argument goes that
an untrained witch or wizard would be unable to control their accidental magic,
and would expose the existence of magic to the non-magical society.  This is
probably reasonable.  Eventually someone would gain sufficient conscious or even
unconscious control over their magic to start using it in very public and very
undeniable ways.  This would eventually lead to investigations into the
abilities, the people who have them, and these investigations, done by any
competent government or reasonably sized organisation, would probably eventually
detect enough of the hidden society to deduce its overall existence. 

The ISWS was only signed by Wizarding Governments, which seem to have a tenuous
relationship with their non-magical counterparts.  In Britain, there is a
separate legislature, separate courts, and a separate "minister," who, based on
the interactions we see, *informs*, not *reports to* the non-magical Prime
Minister.[^210323-5]  This makes for a fairly strong case that while the magical
government *may* in some nebulous sense still recognise the Crown (though that
is certainly not stated and thus is debatable), it is otherwise an entirely
separate government.  

I am told that under non-magical British law, a child does not automatically
gain citizenship merely by being born within British borders.[^210323-6] The
British magical society seems to take the opposite view, that anyone born within
its jurisdiction *is* automatically a citizen, and thus *under* its
jurisdiction.  While children do not normally get to contest what government
rules them, their parents typically *do* (except in cases of those who break the
law and thus have their rights suspended or revoked by due process of the law).
Here we have a situation where a child, by virtue of being born with a
particular trait, is said to be of a different nationality from the parents said
child cohabitates with, and thus under a different jurisdiction, the very existence
of which is unknown to the parent.

Should the child, or the parent acting on behalf of the child, either break the
laws, or even create a situation where the laws are likely to be broken (by not
training the child), the secret government has enacted regulations such that the
child can be irrevocably harmed (I strongly suspect the United Nations would
consider crippling a child's ability to use any skill harm) and the minds of
both parents (who are NOT under the jurisdiction of the secret government) and
child manipulated and modified. 

Since the ISWS was signed *after* the separation of the magical and non-magical
governments into effectively separate countries with overlapping territory, it
is unlikely that the non-magical government had much input into its provisions,
rather they were almost certainly simply informed after the fact, if at all.  A
government might well consider itself bound by a treaty signed by a preceding
government, but not by some essentially unaffiliated government.  The
requirements of the ISWS leave the non-magical government no recourse should
(as essentially happens in Book 7) the magical government become a threat to the
non-magical population. This might have worked in the age of absolute monarchs,
but even in the 1680s and 1690s, Parliament was curtailing the rights of British
monarchs, though not to the extent of today. No government that rules by the
consent of the governed can sign away the rights of its citizens to safeguard
their children the way the ISWS does. 

When the children arrive at [Hogwarts], they are only then told, and that in
piecemeal, that they have in fact joined a new society.  Since the consequences
of withdrawing from that society are never spelled out, it is safe to say that
they are not known to the children *before* they arrive at school.  [Hermione]
would not have risked practising at home before first year[^210323-8] if she
knew it was illegal.  This new "world" they have joined has customs that they
are expected to know, but will not be taught, laws that they must follow, and
*no way out*.

They might not have been kidnapped, in that they can go home for a few weeks at
Christmas, and two months or so each summer, but they will quickly find they fit
in less and less at home.  They cannot show their parents anything from school;
they know nothing of what has gone on in the non-magical society for the last
four to ten months; their non-magical education is frozen at age eleven, so they
lack all sorts of key concepts to even converse with their peers and,
increasingly, with their parents. Perhaps in the 1600s this divide was not all
that severe.  Few non-magical families had much education, and if you did not
come from a farming family, you were probably apprenticed out at a young age
anyway.  However, as non-magical society moved into and then through the
industrial revolution and into the modern era, this changed, and probably
started to create more and more friction between non-magical expectations of how
family works, how society works, and the more stagnant magical society. 

It is in this context that they are then criticised for wanting things to be the
way they were raised to expect. Those who come from old, aggressively magical
families rightly complain that first generation magical users always want to
change things.  They are, however, at fault.  They created the divide between
cultures by refusing to stay connected with the non-magical world on one hand,
and by *forcing* the immigration of the first-generation users on the other.  If
they want their static society, they have options:

* they can actually abduct the first generation children on the first sign of
  magic.  I consider this morally abhorrent, but it would work.  I think this is
  what Mrs. Rowling envisions for [MACUSA] but I refuse to consider that.
* they can exclude first-generation magical users from magical society.  This
  will create risks to the ISWS, but with careful and aggressive use of memory
  charms, it is also possible that a second, un-hidden magical "culture" (or I
  guess sub-culture, since it would actually exist as a sub-component of the
  surrounding non-magical cultures) could develop independent of the ISWS
  culture. I consider the use of memory charms morally repugnant, but the ISWS
  pretty much demands it. 
* they can give up on the ISWS.  This does not necessarily require they give up
  on having a separate government and culture, it *does* require they give up on
  the secrecy.  That in turn means accountability to the surrounding
  populations, something that I am not actually confident that they could
  survive.
