There is no real doubt that most magical people consider themselves, their
lifestyle, cultural institutions and so on superior to non-magical ones.  This
is not just restricted to the bigots like the [Malfoy] family.  [Mr. Weasley]
is fascinated by non-magical things and people, but still talks about them as
if they are clever children.[^220630-3]

[Mr. Weasley]: <../../people/weasley/arthur>

There are two common mistakes that fan fiction writers make dealing with this. 

### The First Fallacy: Magical Society *is* better

The first fallacy is that Magical Society *is* in fact better.  In some ways it
is, in other ways it is not.  There might be reasons for some of the traditions
they have clung to, but like any people, some traditions are traditional simply
because they *want to be different.*[^220630-4]

As an example of this, phoenixgirl26 in _[Observation][pgO1]_ has [Harry] adopt
this attitude of superiority without question.[^220630-5]  He then proceeds to
instruct [Hermione] that robes have pockets *that might be used.*  He had to be
*taught* that you might carry *paper* in your pocket (except, because magic is
always, better, his actual example was a roll of parchment).  I am sorry, but I
figured out that pockets are meant to carry things that might be useful all on
my own, without a class in how the world works.  While I do *not* carry around
a notebook and pen, I have certainly met people who do, and our modern smart
phones essentially replace that need anyway.  But [Harry] apparently needs to
be taught this, because he was raised muggle, and non wizarding folk would
never guess that pockets are anything but ornamental.

[Hermione]: <../../people/granger/hermione>

### The Second Fallacy: Non-Magical Society is always better

Other writers will go to the other extreme.  The magical world is just lost in
the past, or worse, simply stupid, and we really just need to join the
non-magical world.  You typically see this in stories where either the non-magical
government steps in to take care of things,[^220719-4] where [Harry] leaves the
magical world to live as a muggle, or both.  This has ceased to be legitimate
criticism, it is simply bashing on (in this case) a people because it makes the
author feel smart.
