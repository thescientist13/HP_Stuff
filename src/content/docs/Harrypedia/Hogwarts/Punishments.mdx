During [Harry][]'s time there, Filch constantly complains about the punishments
he is and is not allowed to inflict.  I do not know as much about the change in
societal norms on school punishments in British boarding schools as I would
need to know in order to fully evaluate what happens at Hogwarts.  That being
said, we do know that punishments were more extreme not all that long in the
past.  

> Mrs. Weasley grinned, her eyes twinkling. “Your father and I had been for a 
> nighttime stroll,” she said. “He got caught by Apollyon Pringle he was the  
> caretaker in those days your father’s still got the marks.”[^20200720-9] 

Note that [Mrs. Weasley][Molly] is not expressing any negative emotion
here.  She's recounting something she expects [Harry][] and [Bill] to hear and
accept without much surprise.  A [Guardian][] article that is the top Google
result when I try to look up corporal punishment in British schools tells me
that [Harry][] probably never experienced any, but quite possibly heard about
it.[^20200720-10]

[Rex Tims][FfnRT] points out in an authors note that a fifty point penalty is
apparently a big deal, but if so, the end of year point totals seem really
low.[^211109-1]  This is probably another example of Mrs. Rowling's poor maths
skills.
