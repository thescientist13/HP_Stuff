### Teachers

* [[Albus Dumbledore|adults/Dumbledore]]
* [[Cuthbert Binns|adults/Binns]]
* [[Filius Flitwick|adults/Flitwick]]
* [[Minerva McGonagall|adults/McGonagall]]
* [[Severus Snape|adults/Snape]]

In more general terms, what is the role of the head of each house?
[[McGonagall|adults/McGonagall]] shows up to intervene in Gryffindor's internal
discipline only in [[Harry]]'s third year.[^20200811-1]  [[Harry]] finds
[[Luna]] wandering the halls barefoot, posting flyers listing her stolen stuff,
and [[Flitwick|adults/Flitwick]] does nothing.[^20200811-2]  I have a page
dedicated to [[McGonagall|adults/McGonagall]], and it would be hard to write too
much here that would not also go there, so these two examples will have to
suffice for now.  It seems that the school expects the prefects to run the
school.  I am unsure how typical of British boarding schools this is, Stalky of
_[Stalky & Co.][]_ by Rudyard Kipling goes on an extended rant about the evils
of married teachers, and how it puts too much responsibility on the
prefects.[^20210521-6] _Stalky & Co._ is certainly idealised, no doubt in a lot
of ways, but if you read carefully you can tell there is a lot of bullying, it
is a rough life, but it is kept sufficiently in check that most of them come out
of it … typically British (see the quote on bullying in the Students section).
If *Stalky* thinks that it would be *worse* if the teachers he describes do
*less*, well, then we have to assume that the few phrases we have hinting at the
problems within Hogwarts are actually understating things. 

Look at the roles that play out in _Stalky_ versus _Harry Potter_.  In _Stalky_
we see prefects giving out discipline, including corporal punishment, but each house
has a head that advocates for its students, steps in for discipline problems
within the house beyond the scope or abilities of the prefects, and is generally
present and visible not just as a teacher, but *as a head of house*.  Indeed, in
_Stalky_, the prefects are rarely mentioned, several of the school masters who
head Houses are the most frequent disciplinarians (this might be because Stalky
has the prefects totally intimidated).  The Head is called in for exceptional
problems, and if I recall, the punishment is made especially severe to
discourage "bothering the Head."  Does any of this sound like Hogwarts?  At
Hogwarts every problem most likely not at all, otherwise by the prefects, and
finally, by [[Dumbledore|adults/Dumbledore]] with [[Snape|adults/Snape]]
attending as advisor, no matter who is involved.  Never mind
[[McGonagall|adults/McGonagall]] is Deputy Head, and therefore more logically
the advisor at that point, we need a more Charles Dickens feel about it.  Which
is probably precisely the point.
