title: "Horcruxes"
author: "Luke Schierer"
---

First of all, I'm not going to even start about what the proper plural is.
I do not care.  Horcruxes works, and I am going to go with that.

I am also going to use this page for the general discussion of whatever
magic it was that 1) allowed [Riddle] to survive hitting [Harry] with the
killing curse and 2) affects [Harry]'s scar regardless of if that magic
is actually a horcrux or not.

### Origin

One place I want to quibble with cannon is on the origin of Horcruxes. Mrs.
Rowling would have Herpo the Foul be essentially the prefigurement of
[Riddle], an evil dark wizard who deals with Parseltongue, a basilisk, and
a horcrux.[^210323-9]  She tries to rescue this a bit by saying in an
interview that others experimented with this before him, but did not
succeed.[^210323-10]  This might be nice neat foreshadowing for a novel,
but I find it unrealistic and hokey world building; the caveat made in the
interview is too little, too late.

If Herpo did use a Horcrux, he would have lived somewhere between the 12th
and 9th century BC[^210323-11], which debunks the Chinese origin of the
magic put forth in _[The Mandatory Marriage Contract Fic][]_.[^210323-12]

DisobedienceWriter wrote a fairly extensive one-shot, _[The Valley of the
Kings Massacre][TVotKM]_, which focused a fair amount on horcruxes.  I
dislike the characterisation of [Harry] in this work, but I do like
some of the backstory it posits. He suggests that the Egyptian priest class
delved deep into runic magic and soul magic, including Horcruxes and "the
ancestor of the modern Killing Curse."[^210323-14] In my mind both the
killing curse and horcruxes are evil, the first requiring hatred, the
second requiring the remorseless killing of an innocent. DisobedianceWriter
suggests that one could be created with any killing, I think Rowling's
interview comments require something more gruesome.[^210323-15]  Of
particular note, the Valley of the Kings was in use from the 16th to the
11th century BC.[^210323-13]  For my purposes the overlap is actually useful.

Despite the parts I dislike, I *do* like the idea that the Egyptian priests
played the ruling class, developed horcruxes, and that, unlike Itsme66's
theory, horcruxes do work.  It keeps me more in line with cannon, but gets
rid of the over convenient root of all evil version of Herpo.  To mesh back
in with cannon, it is my thought that, since Ancient Greece and Egypt had
at least some contact, Herpo stole the magic theory behind horcruxes from
the Egyptians. Hence it being convenient that the two civilisations overlap
in time.

Several centuries later, Wong Shan-Hao (from Itsme66's work) attempted a
horcrux, but botched the creation, explaining the intact one on display in
the Imperial Museum of Magic.[^210324-1]  [Dumbledore]'s failure to know
about and properly investigate what an intact horcrux is doing in the
Imperial Museum is a testimony to his overall dependence on the prophecy,
and failure to act.

### Effects on the Creator

There are several competing theories on what effect the creation of a
horcrux would have on the person creating it.  The cannon books, to my
memory, do not speak to this at all, and supplementary works Mrs. Rowling
has since published online do, I similarly do not recall seeing it.

* Christian theology states that thought is at least partially a power of
  the soul.[^210810-1]  If you fragment your soul, you then, logically,
  fragment your ability to think.  You would thus render yourself either
  less intelligent, less sane, or both.
* As a slight variation to the above, it may be not your *intelligence*
  that is effected so much as less tangible aspects of your humanity.  You
  may become more sociopathic, psychopathic, or both.[^210810-2]
* As a variation on either of the above, the effects may only be felt as
  the horcruxes are destroyed.[^220714-2]
* Magical ability may be linked to the soul.  If your horcrux is destroyed,
  you may lose some portion of your ability to project magical power, your
  stamina for so projecting, or both.[^221118-1]
* What does it mean to "split" an immaterial soul?  Is such a split a 50/50
  spit, or is the horcrux a true "fragment" - that is a very small part of
  the whole?  If the former, how much of the soul must remain anchored to
  earth to prevent the death of the whole?
* Along the same lines as the prior point, what would it take for a horcrux
  to show up on the Marauder's Map?  It would be interesting to know, though
  of course we do not, if Tom showed up during Harry's first year.

#### Tom Riddle specifically

Tom was said to be charming[^210810-3], clever,[^210810-8] able to fool
even the very wise.[^210810-9] How much of that do we see in the version of
Riddle who appears on the back of Quirrell's head?  He makes a superficial
attempt to persuade Harry to join him, before he starts snarling and
threatening.[^210810-10] His followers in the latter books seem to follow
more out of fear than out of any real expectation of gain or power.

### Harry's Scar

Cannon makes it very clear that Mrs. Rowling has gone with 6 horcruxes plus
[Harry]'s scar, plus the portion of the soul that floats around for the
first three point something books and is finally fully resurrected at the
end of book four. That is fine, and her prerogative. When it comes to
[Harry]'s scar, I think that cannon is a bit ambiguous, and leaves open
some legitimate speculation.  If you include interviews as part of cannon,
then it starts to lean heavily in favour of it being … complicated.[^200731-1]

I first read this in [The Thorny Rose 2][TTR213]:

> "But if you know about the Horcruxes, then you will know that they can only be
> destroyed by the most destructive of forces. There is no way Harry could
> survive that,"the old wizard pointed out.
>
> "What’s the matter? Is your hearing going? As I just said; that would be the
> case if Harry was a proper Horcrux, but he isn’t! His body was never prepared
> in the correct manner that Horcrux receptacles are required to be and he
> wasn’t subjected to a Binding Ritual, either. Voldemort’s sliver of soul isn’t
> properly integrated with Harry’s," Ginny yelled in anger.[^210311-1]

However I now know that this theory is more or less exactly what Mrs. Rowling
intended:[^200731-2] a horcrux has to be intentional, the bit of soul in
[Harry]'s scar is not, therefor he is not a true horcrux. Because he is not a
true horcrux, it cannot take him over the way a real one would.  The pain is
the bit of soul trying to rejoin the rest of [Riddle]; and the few times we see
it actually influencing [Harry] it is because he is, independently, emotionally
vulnerable to it due to feeling things similar to what Riddle would have been feeling.

Interestingly she insists that despite the fact that he is not a true horcrux, he
would have had to be destroyed the same way.[^210323-1] I, like [Ginny] in the fan
fiction above, disagree on that.  It does not make sense. I prefer the theory
"Anything enchanted can be disenchanted … there are many poor methods to solve a
problem, but usually only one or a small number of elegant options."[^210323-2]
Under this theory, few if any researchers have ever discovered a way to disenchant
a Horcrux that does *not* involve destruction of the object.  Of those who did
discover such a way, they either left no records, left records inaccessible to
[Dumbledore], or (nearly the same thing) were someone considered untrustworthy by
[Dumbledore] and thus not consulted. A variation of this theory is that there
are people that [Dumbledore] trusts (like [Bill] Weasley) who had studied such
records, but [Dumbledore] was so paranoid about knowledge of Horcruxes that
he did not ask even people he trusted.[^210323-3]

Of course all of this assumes that the soul fragment is actually attached
to *[Harry]* and not something embedded in his scar.[^210330-46]  It is very
clear that Mrs. Rowling intends precisely that; works with something in the
scar really fall into the "nonsense" section below.

### Mostly Unsupported Nonsense

[LLTQ]: https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11500936

Even though the other 6 have no real legitimate room for speculation given
what is in cannon, it would be _fun_ if we did. I will not promise that I
will not ever do so in anything I attempt to write. I really hadn't
considered just how much fun you could have with this until I read
offsides' [Long Live The Queen][LLTQ].
From Chapter 32:

> “I've reviewed the diary," said Croaker, jumping straight in, "along with
> interviewing both the victim Miss Weasley, as well as Mister Potter.
> Based on what I learned, I'm confident that it was not a Horcrux."
>
> The Chief Wizard let out a small sigh of relief, though he knew it didn't
> mean that Voldemort hadn't actually made one later. "Do you know what it
> was?" he asked.
>
> "Yes and no," replied Croaker. "I'm pretty sure I know what it did and
> how it worked from the big picture, but not how it was made or many of
> the details.  In fact, I've never seen or found anything in my research
> quite like it. As you recall, a Horcrux holds a piece of the soul,
> which could theoretically be used to take over another body. This," he
> held up the diary, "was almost the exact opposite.
>
> "After checking it for various residual traces, I found no indication that

> temporary repository for one. Based on the memories of Miss Ginny Weasley,
> it became clear that while the diary contained some sort of consciousness
> that interacted with her “the one thing it lacked was a soul, which it
> was slowly leeching as she wrote more and more in the diary. I also
> reviewed the memory of Harry Potter from his encounter with the construct
> of Tom Marvolo Riddle when he ultimately destroyed the diary, and from that
> came to a rather astonishing conclusion.”
>

Imagine the staggering implications of that.  It is the one criticism I
have of that story, that the author _did not_ really explore the can of
worms that section opens up. Basically, what if Riddle really had done
experiments, _plural_ such that neither he nor Dumbledore could know which
had prevented him from truly dying?  The idea is not without cannon
support, Riddle implies as much in the graveyard scene.

> I, who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to
> immortality. You know my goal to conquer death. And now, I was tested, and
> it appeared that one or more of my experiments had worked . . . for I had
> not been killed, though the curse should have done it.[^200625-2]

Six essentially identical horcruxes really doesn't constitute a situation
where you would say "one or more of my experiments had worked."  I mean,
the idea that so many authors have that you have to consume a horcrux to
resurrect Riddle is silly and rather insulting. It is hardly an immortality
device if it only preserves you from a single death that is bound to happen
at some point eventually. But if a horcrux can be properly understood as an
anchor that need not be consumed, then while the idea of a 7 part soul
might be interesting and all, the idea of having several totally different
types of anchors is really just *fascinating.*  It would be so easy to do
too, let Riddle be enamoured with the idea of a seven part soul, that does
not mean it is possible, let there be some arithmetical limit he hits
before that, so that it is something he tried for, but ultimately could not
do.

On the opposite side of the spectrum, souls are clearly not really
*splitable* at all.  If the soul was *truly* split, then the horcrux would
not anchor you to this life, the death of one half would simply not affect
the other.  That is probably where the idea that a horcrux gets consumed in
a resurrection comes from, because the author implicitly assumes that there
is no wraith to resurrect. The problem is that Riddle's existence in the
first book contradicts the theory.  The part of his soul that was not in a
horcrux did not pass on, but rather fled, without a body (or container) to
the forest in Albania.[^210324-4]

Building on that, given that the soul does not really split, lets force the
death of one segment, by throwing a horcrux through the veil, and let it
pull the other segments through with it.[^210324-5] The cannon discrepancy
from that work is that the diary horcrux was destroyed by the basilisk
fang, so while the soul parts are not entirely disconnected (and so can be
anchors) they are not entirely connected either (the containers can be
de-horcrux-ified if destroyed).

I suppose you could speculate on if the *soul fragment* was destroyed with
the diary or not.  It is theoretically possible that instead of dying that
soul fragment was released from the container.  The problem then would be
explaining what is up with [Harry]'s scar, since we are told that a
soul fragment latched on to him, instead of rejoining some other soul
fragment (or the main soul piece that was the wraith).

Alternately, it seems to be a favourite idea in any number of fan fiction
works to think that resurrecting the person who created the horcrux
consumes that horcrux.  Under this theory, the portion of the soul in the
killed body, or destroyed horcrux, *does* pass on, but having left behind a
portion of their soul anchored to this world, that portion can be attached
to a body, and will become the new primary fragment.  I see no support for
this idea in cannon, nor, counting the various horcruxes that [Harry] and
[Dumbledore] between them find and destroy, do I see room for one to have
been used but not mentioned in book four.  This idea suffers from many of
the rebuttals listed above as well.

More rarely, but closely in line with my first entry in this section, is
the idea that Harry's scar is *not* a soul fragment.[^220728-4]  Many of
these authors believe that there ought to be a maximum number of splits.
If that were true, if [Riddle][] intended to create his seventh horcrux
with/at [Harry]'s murder, then he was at six soul parts. This is not a
[stable number][], but also not a notably *unstable* one.[^220728-5]  For
this theory to work, [Riddle][] ought to have been at [eleven][], or
[thirteen][] parts.
