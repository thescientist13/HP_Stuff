## Description

> I find the Serpensortia charm to be… problematic. The description in the
> books is a bit vague, but seems to imply that Malfoy created the snake,
> rather than summoning it. I don't like the idea of it being a true
> conjuration, that is, creating something from nothing. The idea that Malfoy
> is skilled enough as a 2nd year to conjure a snake that can understand
> parseltongue is ridiculous. In book 6, Hermione conjures some birds while
> moping about Ron and Lavender, and Harry is impressed by her spell work.
> Surely a snake would be at least as difficult, if not more so. So, I decided
> to go with the non-spatial summoning charm described above.[^210629-6]

The transcription of the [Book of Spells][] references a "Principle of
Artificianimate Quasi-Dominance" and goes on to state that for poorly understood
and entirely unstated reasons, birds and snakes are easier to conjur than
anything else.[^210930-21]  I do not feel this rather hand-wavy
quasi-explanation truly addresses Mr. Hycrest's objections above.
