title: "The Mind Arts"
author: "Luke Schierer"

For lack of a better word, I am going to call [Occlumency][] and [Legilimency][]
"the Mind Arts," and not "the Mental Arts" because these are magics dealing with
the mind, whereas "mental arts" could be almost anything *using* your mind.  I
am trying to distinguish, however imperfectly, the mind as an object versus the
mind as a means. 

[Occlumency]: <{{< relref "Occlumency" >}}>

[Legilimency]: <{{< ref "Harrypedia/magic/spells/Legilimens" >}}>

I dislike [Occlumency][O1].  I am resigned to accepting a definition of it that I
am fairly confident is intended to be canonical to this universe; the problem
is that definition is an unacceptable practice.  You can read my rant on it for
details.

[O1]: <{{< relref "Occlumency" >}}>

Given that [Occlumency][O2] is a flawed Art, one that will work for only some
people, and can be used safely only for short durations, can we accept that the
magical world has no other way to protect the privacy of one's thoughts or the
integrity of one's mind?  This seems unacceptable.  Look at the number of
threats that people face in that society. 

* I cannot prove it from cannon sources, but I am fairly confident that
  Professor Dumbledore uses [Legilimency][L1] on students regularly.  I started
  thinking that as soon as I re-read _The Chamber of Secrets_ after finding out
  about Legilimency.  

* Love potions can be made by young people. This is considered acceptable. 
  "Mrs. Weasley was telling Hermione and Ginny about a love potion she’d made as
  a young girl. All three of them were rather giggly."[^20200716-1]

* The false Mad-eye says of the Imperius Curse that it can be fought, but that
  not everyone has the strength of character to do it successfully, and that it
  was difficult for the Ministry to know who was under it and not.[^20200716-3]

* Memories get modified.  This happens so frequently across the series it hardly
  requires documentation. 

* This is almost a special case of the above, but you can be made to forget
  (Obliviate).

* Hermione uses a "Confundus Charm" to confuse McLaggen in sixth
  year.[^20200716-2]

So you are going to walk around in a society where everyone is capable of at
least some of the above list, aware of all of it, and probably knows at least
some details of how to use most of it, without any defence except quick
reflexes for your generic shield charm, and an ability to detect and avoid
potions? 

It is all well and good for a man with an eye effectively in the back of his
head to spout "Constant Vigilance" all the time, but most of us have blind
spots behind us.  Students start learning silent casting in sixth year, and it
seems no one fails to make it into at least one NEWT level course at Hogwarts.
Silent casting is part of Defence, Charms, and Transfiguration.  Any one of the
three classes and you have been exposed to the concept.  Assume you can remain
in Hogwarts with as few as two or three NEWT level classes.  We know that
Potions has a very low acceptance rate.  I believe we are told that Arithmancy
and Ancient Runes are considered hard courses.  However, while the course work
for Divination can be made up, note that Harry failed the OWL, the standardised
exams seem to require that you actually succeed at using magic; that makes this
a hard course.  Astronomy requires a lot of memorisation, but apparently nothing
else, I imagine a Goyle might be coached through to an E there.  History of
Magic requires studying outside of class, Slytherin house may consider it
unacceptably disgraceful to fail that class, he might have an E there as well;
that's two.  I do not know that we have ever seen a wand in Herbology, but as
the plants get more dangerous, I expect that you use your wand in one way or
another, and I expect that in sixth year you are expected to do so silently.  So
if even three classes are required to stay in sixth year, then everyone is
exposed to the idea of silent casting.

Worse, while I need to look up the citations, for some of these spells, failing
to cast them is worse for the victim than doing so successfully.  Bertha Jorkins
is damaged by a memory charm cast incorrectly.  Barty Crouch is damaged by
*resisting* an imperius curse.  Gilderoy is damaged by an *correctly* cast, but
overly strong, charm.  So an inexperienced or self-taught attacker might be more
dangerous than an official government agent out to practice governmental mind
control.  Everyone knows the incantations and and movements, everyone knows how
not to get caught, and messing up has worse consequences than succeeding.

And no one has developed any defence at all except "Constant Vigilance?"  Bogus.

So what might those defences look like?  Well, the best source of ideas is the
way different fanfictions attempt to explain [Occlumency][].  These would not
really be [Occlumency][], but they *might* be other magical arts that replace,
supplement, or complement it.  Perhaps even ones that do not cause damage with
long term use.
