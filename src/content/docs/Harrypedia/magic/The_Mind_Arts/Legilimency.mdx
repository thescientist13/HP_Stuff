Legilimency might not be quite reading your thoughts like a book, but it
certainly seems to come close.  Though I have not seen it myself, this
is apparently especially true if you include the _Fantastic Beasts and
Where To Find Them_ movie.[^20200630-8] According to what I have read,
Mrs. Rowling's comments on that movie indicate that Legilimency is not
just a skill you can learn, but one that you can essentially be born with.

Before reading that, my thoughts were certainly trending in the direction
of the [dark arts]. The fact that [Dumbledore] makes fairly free use of
Legilimency[^20200630-9] is really more proof of the morally ambiguous nature
of [Dumbledore]; I am the last person to whitelist a practice just because
he does it.  Certainly the idea of intruding on a person's thoughts, memories
and emotions is invasive.  That by itself isn't enough to render it evil
though.  It is more the way [Snape] uses it I suppose, the way he batters
[Harry] with it, leaving Harry with migraines and nightmares that starts me
down that path. I am not sure where, but I have also read at least one author
speculate that a skilled Legilimens might not just be able to read and
interpret, but might be able to implant and influence thoughts, emotions, maybe
even manipulate memories. That, to me, would unquestionably be a violation of
the person's free will, and thus evil.

Still, I refuse to believe that someone is born evil.  Now the fallen nature of
humanity is a very very real thing.  We tend towards sin.  But we also have
free will, and sufficient free will to turn towards God  and respond to grace.
Moreover the Devil can only corrupt, not create.  The idea that you can be born
with a *skill* that is inherently immoral to use is repugnant.  One that can
only be used in specific context, in narrow ways, fine.  Theology has to deal
with concupiscense and chastity already afterall.  But if [Queenie Goldstein]
is born instinctively practicing Legilimency, there must be a moral context in
which it is acceptable.  A time, a place, and a method by which she can use her
gift, even if she must (or at least should) learn to reign it in some or even
most of the time.

Still, whether or not Legilimency is not itself inherently evil, and given that
[Occlumency] is inherently flawed, the methods of defense against it that are
presented to us by Mrs. Rowling are woefully insufficient. There has to be
something that you can do to defend your privacy, and potentially even the
integrity of your mind, without risking damage to yourself.

Lastly, as I discuss when considering [Mental Shields] as an alternative to
[Occlumency], using Legilimency must in some way undermine any defenses you
may have against being yourself attacked with it.  Whatever [Snape] does to
protect his own thoughts, when he is attacking [Harry]'s mind, he feels the
need to take the extra step of removing certain thoughts to make them that much
more inaccessible.[^20191119-9]

On a side note, several authors before me have speculated that [Snape]
routinely uses this skill on [Harry] throughout the books, and that it is
only because [Harry], our narrator, is himself unaware of it, that we in turn
are not made more aware of it.[^221216-1]

    This is a charitable interpretation.  The alternative is that [Snape] was
    laying a trap for [Harry], that he fully intended that [pensieve] to
    eventually be left alone in the room with [Harry] and to be spied upon.
