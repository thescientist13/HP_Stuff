### Analysis
### timeline Speculation

* Dumbledore became Headmaster after [Lupin][RL1] was bitten.[^200720-6]  Since
  [Lupin][RL1] was a classmate of [James] and [Lily], he was born in either late
  1959 or early 1960.[^200813-1]  Since he was bitten at age four,
  that puts us in approximately 1964.[^200813-2]
* However, Dumbledore's memory of [Riddle][TMR1]'s timeline says that
  [Riddle][TMR1]'s job interview was ten years after he murdered Hepzibah
  Smith.[^210810-6] That would mean that [Riddle][TMR1] was with Borgin and
  Burke for something like 20 years.[^210810-7]  This seems improbable, as he
  is still described as "young" when he left the shop.[^210810-8]
* It does, however fit with the emergence of [Riddle][TMR1] and the Death
  Eaters as a terrorist force, which the [timeline][H1] places around
  1970.
* Thus my guess is that Dumbledore *collected* the memory from the house elf ten
  years prior to the interview, not that the the house elf *formed* the memory
  ten years prior.  Note, this actually puts Dumbledore in a really poor light.

### Character Analysis

Some authors assume that Dumbledore is completely evil, and is in fact the Dark
Lord of the prophecy.[^210706-1]  The problem with this is the "neither shall
live" part, but then that is nearly as much of a problem if you look too closely
at the cannon events.  For myself, I do not think Dumbledore intentionally
shaped [Riddle][TMR1] into Voldemort,[^210706-2] nor that he is secretly the most
dastardly person imaginable.  Dumbledore is not a saintly figure either mind
you, but rather a complex one who requires more careful analysis to understand
his flaws in the right context.

Musings of Apathy, in writing the original version of [Family Inseparable][FI],
envisions Dumbledore as (my words) misguided, and perhaps ruthless, but not
evil.[^180702-2]  There is some truth to this.  Personally, I am convinced that
Dumbledore believes some form of [Utilitarianism][IEPU2].  Whether he absorbed
this from [Gellert Grindelwald][GG],[^221221-6] or learned it from his own
parents is more than I am perpared to say.  It even is possible that
[Grindelwald][GG] got the idea from *Dumbledore*.  Moreover, for all that "the
Greater Good" would become [Grindelwald][GG]'s slogan,[^221221-7] I do not
believe that Dumbledore ever, if at all, fully abandoned his internal
commitment to [Utilitarian][IEPU2] philosophy.  Dumbledore may have had to learn to
live with the "price of [his] shame,"[^210912-8] but I cannot find anywhere that
says he actually came to believe his moral reasoning had been flawed.

Dumbledore's father went to prison for unilaterally using magic to punish some
non-magical boys who so tramatized [Ariana][] Dumbledore that she lost control
of her mental facualties, and with that, her control over her magic.[^221220-8]
This belief that he had the right to vengance speaks to a belief in superiority
that seems common to the wizarding world, we see it in the [Weasleys][] as well
for example.[^221221-9]  Dumbledore no doubt grew up seeing the world this way,
instinctively believing those without magic to be lesser than him.  I believe
he took it a step further.  I believe he saw those with lesser magical ability
as lesser than him as well.  He is a kind of ivory tower intelectual who views
those who lack his achievements as perpetual children, irregardless of their
actual age relative to himself.  As he grows older, this is exacerbated  Many
of the adult decision makers he now works with were once his students, not his
peers, far less ever adults over him.

[Saving the Saviour]: https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11833745/14/Saving-the-Saviour

One of the things that really struck me as I started to really
think about the Harry Potter books (as opposed to just enjoying them as
stories), is just how valid some of the common fan fiction criticisms of
Dumbledore are.  In no particular order:

* Dumbledore does not seem to know about the horcruxes until he is
  presented with the diary.  He knew [Riddle][TMR1] had survived the Halloween
  encounter with [Harry], and that [Slughorn][HS] knew something about
  this,[^220916-1], but apparently did nothing to investigate this beyond just
  enough questions to drive [Slughorn][HS] away from [Hogwarts][].[^220916-2]
* [Harry]'s scar as a horcrux:
  * [Saving the Saviour] talks about how Dumbledore didn't have [Harry] examined at all by a
    Healer after that fateful Halloween night.  Could the soul fragment
    [Riddle][TMR1] left have been detected?  Could something have been done
    about it?
  * See the discussion on [Harry]'s scar in [Horcruxes][DMH1]
* More or less a follow up to the previous point, but further consider.
  Dumbledore states that he did not know that [Harry] would survive.
  Dumbledore _hoped_ that [Harry] would.  Dumbledore, by his own admission,
  knows that [Harry] will be willing to sacrifice himself.  The reason
  implied is that Dumbledore is well aware of [Harry]'s heroic virtue.
  But when you consider how much Dumbledore hid from [Harry], how
  calculated the final revelation is, I think there is more to it.  Dumbledore
  is not leaving anything to chance - I agree with fan fiction authors who
  think that Dumbledore has, in the choices he has made regarding
  [Harry]'s upbringing, purposefully worked to shape [Harry] into
  someone who will make that choice.  This does not negate [Harry]'s
  virtue; Dumbledore is building on [Harry]'s nature, not creating it out
  of whole cloth.  Honestly, if Dumbledore were as calculating about subjecting
  [Harry] to abuse as some authors would have him, then he took an
  incredibly reckless chance.  Dumbledore knows how similar [Harry]'s
  situation is to [Riddle][TMR1]'s childhood.  I think that this plan is
  something that Dumbledore came to over time, not something he intended from
  the beginning.
* Dumbledore placed Mrs. Figg to watch [Harry].  She knows she has to be
  unpleasant to him to retain access to him and thus fulfil her mission.
  Surely this was reported to Dumbledore over the years.  He presumably
  did not believe her, possibly because she is a squib, and he has some
  of the pure-blood's unconscious prejudices against them.  Alternately,
  while he does believe her, he risks both [Harry] turning evil and
  [Harry]'s health, because he views the odds that [Harry] will be
  killed by a Death Eater and/or a returned [Riddle][TMR1] that probable.
  There _must_ have been some middle ground.  Between Dumbledore's civil
  authority on the Wizengamot, and his experience with and control over magic,
  he could have done *something* to intervene in [Harry]'s treatment.
* The above and [much more][ADtoh] concerning [Harry].
* And even more about [how he dealt with Riddle][ADdwr].

Against this collection of problems is Dumbledore's friendship with Fawkes.  How
intelligent are phoenixes?  Does the phoenix bond with its partner (popular in
fan fiction), or is it more of a friendship thing?  A phoenix in the HP world is
a highly loyal creature.[^210914-2]  Would this loyalty persist if Dumbledore
started to believe his own legend and allow power to corrupt him? We do not, to
my knowledge, have good answers to any of these questions.
> Fawkes slept soundly on his perch. Being willing to sacrifice one boy's life
> and happiness was a horrible decision to make, but not an outright evil one.
> Plus, the stories everyone believed about phoenixes had been started by
> Dumbledore anyway. At the end of the day, though highly magical, unicorns were
> just horses and phoenixes were just birds.[^191025-1]

For my purposes, Fawkes recognises this good intent, but is not intelligent enough (a
phoenix is an animal, not a being) to understand the flaws in Dumbledore's
execution.  In any case, I am not about to allow an animal, particularly not a
fictional representation of an even more fictional animal, to decide for me
whether or not someone is acting morally or not. If you do convince me that the
phoenix *should* be a moral indicator, then I would be forced to conclude that
either Fawkes is held in bondage in some way[^210914-3], or that Mrs. Rowling
has misrepresented phoenix-kind.

Ms. Richa Venkatraman wrote a defence of Dumbledore on MuggleNet[^190301-1] in
which she seems to express well the view that [Harry] himself has in the book,
that Dumbledore is ultimately a good, if flawed, person.  I suspect that Ms.
Venkatraman is right, that Dumbledore suffers in his conscience from the pain
he causes, and he does *intend* good.  I differ from her in that I do not think
that his *intent* sufficient such that he *is* in fact good (or at least, not
wholely so).  Dumbledore's unstated philosophy seems way too close to "the ends
justify the means," and I am far from convinced that it differs in any
important detail.  _[Keep Holding On][]_ summarized this well:

>The man sitting across from him, looking old and weary, had been involved in so many battles, so many wars, and had seen an infinite amount of casualties. He had defeated Grindelwald and had led the fight against Voldemort during the First War, and was gearing up for a second one. And it was because of all of this, Sirius realized, it was because of all the bloodshed, carnage, and violence he'd witnessed, that he was now numb to it. He could deliver platitudes, speak words of supposed wisdom to those who were grieving, but could not truly feel the losses anymore. His thoughts were always about the bigger picture, about who could be sacrificed to achieve the goal of defeating Voldemort. At that instant Sirius knew Albus still had a heart, still had a conscience, but it had been ravaged and spoiled by all it had seen.[^230216-1]

[Keep Holding On]: <https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13056322>

[^230216-1]: ChoCedric. _[Keep Holding On][]_. Published: 2018-09-04. Updated: 2023-02-16.

The ends (the greater good) do not justify the means (cooperating with (in a
moral sense) the abuse [Harry] suffers).  Similarly, Dumbledore is right,
children do need to learn to deal with all sorts of people, even difficult
authority figures.[^211022-4]  However, *his* responsibility, as headmaster, is
to foster a healthy, safe, and effective learning environment.  Students might
learn *a* valuable lesson about dealing with difficult people from their
interactions with [Snape][SS], but only at great cost to their education.
Potions class is *not* a safe, healthy or effective learning environment.

Dumbledore's "greater good" philosophy thus falls on the wrong side of the
"Wrong Answers" objection to utilitarianism.[^210914-4]  While I did not discuss
that objection in [my own attack][Society/utilitarianism], I did link to one.
Dumbledore would, I believe, deny that he is guilty of this because he himself
does not *directly* act to cause harm.  For me, as a Catholic, this is an
insufficient defence.  Dumbledore is, effectively, relying on either the double
effect defence (which can be valid), or is on the fact that *he* did not commit
evil, others did that.  He would be wise enough to use the two defences in
different circumstances across the books.

[Society/utilitarianism]: https://www.schierer.org/~luke/log/Society/utilitarianism/

The principle of the double effect can be a valid defence.[^210914-5]  It only
actually applies to morally good and morally neutral acts done for good ends
that have incidental evil by-products.  Thus Dumbledore might justify placing
[Harry] with the [Dursleys][DF1] if he *truly* **only** intended to save his
life, and did not also intend the "dark" and "difficult years"[^200624-2] to
temper a perceived Potter tendency towards over-egoism.  If [Harry]'s
suffering was an *aim* of the placement, then the act was not morally good nor
even morally neutral, and thus not protected by this principle even if saving
his life was also intended.  We naturally cannot definitively know which of
these alternatives is the case.  That being said, the one thing I keep coming
back to is echoed in at least one fan fiction I have read:

> No, he could not admit he knew anything about the abuse. He could not
> admit that he had actually planned for it, to keep young Harry humble
> and meek; that he was now trying to duplicate it through Serverus'
> good offices.
>
> The world did not need another Voldemort: a powerful magical user working at
> the top of his skill level, with curiosity and drive and ambition. And with
> enough hatred to doom the entire world.
>
> The world also did not need a Harry Potter raised by Sirius Black amid
> privilege and wealth and freedom. That wouldn't do.
>
> No, the world needed this Harry, shy, polite, an indifferent student, and utterly
> incurious, save for what he could learn about his parents.[^200721-1]

While that fan fiction's depiction of [Harry] is somewhat out of character, it
is close enough that the depiction of Dumbledore's thoughts, here quoted, is
disturbingly believable.  Dumbledore had some power in the [Wizengamot][HPwc],
though we do not know how much we do know that on his word alone [Snape][SS] is
kept out of Azkaban.[^220916-2]  Despite this, Dumbledore claims to be totally
unable to assist [Sirius][SB3] in exonerating himself.  Is this just a convenient
excuse to prevent [Sirius][SB3] from being able to adopt [Harry]?

[Occlumency]: <../../magic/the_mind_arts/occlumency>

Other acts Dumbledore would have to defend by saying it was not his actions in
any sense.  Dumbledore directed [Snape][SS] to teach [Occlumency][], and claims
he trusted that it would be done professionally.[^210914-6]  He would say he is
morally blameless for the lack of oversight not only for these lessons, but for
all of [Snape][SS]'s behaviour across the series.  Again, this argument falls
short. Dumbledore has assigned [Snape][SS] this role, and has ignored complaints
about the way the role has been executed, not just once, but repeatedly.  Thus
Dumbledore is, in Catholic terms, guilty of (in this case) Immediate Material
Cooperation with evil[^200624-1] (Dubmledore's protection of [Snape][SS] is
necessary for the act).  Once [Snape][SS] is accused, Dumbledore's failure to
investigate forces this determination (or at least Proximate Mediate Material
Cooperation, which is still a guilt condition).  This is just one example,
others are possible.

Notice that even with Remote Mediate Material Cooperation, Catholic theology
would require that Dumbledore exercise caution. Should he truly be *unknowing*,
then he is naturally blameless, but I suspect he's more often being wilfully
ignorant if not aware and actually negligent.  He is, to the extent that he
does know of the evil results, or could and should know if he exercised a
normal level of prudence, required to assess if his actions have a
proportionately serious reason.  I suspect that Dumbledore always does this, so
he is not guilty where his cooperation is Remote Mediate Material Cooperation.

There comes a point at which the way he (Dumbledore) has been blind to the
situation with [Snape][SS] ceases to be an act of omission, of merely
neglecting to do (or even notice) something, and makes one an active
accomplice.  Dumbledore allowed both the marauders and the Weasley twins what
appears to have been fairly free reign.  The marauders certainly and the
Weasleys likely crossed the line between humour and cruelty in their so called
pranks.  Given that [Snape][SS] and Filch are our primary source for this
opinion and that neither is reliable, take any impression of the two sets of
pranksters with a grain of salt.  For a discussion on Dumbledore it does not
really matter.  As Headmaster, he was responsible to keep all students safe.
If the marauder's pranks were justified by the injustice they fought, so much
the worse for Dumbledore. If the pranks were truly unjustified, the difference
hardly helps his (Dumbledore's) case.  Either way the students had to defend
themselves with no intervention from authority.

Now sure, it isn't entirely fair to hold Dumbledore fully accountable to
Catholic theology when he isn't Catholic.  That isn't to say that Catholic
teachings aren't universally true and applicable, they are.  Rather, I
am allowing that Dumbledore may be granted some leniency because he may
honestly think that his judgements are both cogent and true. To the extent
that he is wrong about either the cogency or the ultimate validity of his
values and judgements, he can be judged to be sinful, but not mortally
sinful, and thus not evil. It is only where he is self deceptive, that
is he knows his arguments are either not cogent or not based on true
value propositions, that he can be held mortally accountable, and thus
potentially evil.  In this Dumbledore contrasts positively with [Riddle][TMR1],
who quite frankly doesn't care about either the cogency or the validity
of his decisions. Dumbledore is certainly *less evil* though possibly
*more morally dangerous* (in that he is more insidious) than [Riddle][TMR1].

Dumbledore might (almost certainly is) wrong about what the Greater
Good looks like. He is certainly wrong about what he can and cannot do
to achieve it. I do, however, think that it is actually some version
of good for the greatest number of people, and not merely for himself,
that guides his actions. The reader can decide if this is damning him
with faint praise, or giving him what little credit is due.

That being said, was Dumbledore a master of [manipulation][ADmm], or was he
just as much reacting to an out of control situating that he abhorred as
[Harry] is?  In other words, just how much of the world situation is he in
fact responsible for?  While we cannot ultimately know, I return to
Dumbledore's inaction.  The end of [Chapter 4][PaMOD41] is too long to block
quote and expect my point to come across, but it does convey what I am thinking
fairly well.  Consider:

* Dumbledore knows that [Riddle][TMR1] will return: this is his justification for
  leaving [Harry] with the [Dursleys][DF1].
* Dumbledore seemingly does nothing about this for eleven years.
* Dumbledore not only does nothing about [Riddle][TMR1], he allows
  [Malfoy][] and others to be a continued influence on society.
* Dumbledore conveniently sets up a situation where [Riddle][TMR1] will be at
  [Hogwarts][] the same year [Harry] starts.[^210915-1]
* Dumbledore learns of the [Horcruxes][] no later than the end of the second book,
  yet it is not until the summer between the fifth and sixth that he has found
  even one.

This train of thought leads this version of Sirius to the following:
> "No one will be hurting Harry even if I couldn't get rid of the Horcrux- Oh I
> know Albus, one of the perks of coming from a family such as mine," he
> finished leaning back again and continued studying his hand instead of looking
> at Albus, as if he was remembering something far away. "I never believed in
> that prophecy and will do everything to make sure that adults take care of the
> problem, not a child," he turned to look Albus in the eye, "You can work with
> me or against me. But think on this, right now Voldemort is a disembodied
> spirit, have you thought of what might happen if we get rid of all the Horcrux
> he has made? Because I'm sure there wasn't just that one. But tell me, what
> are you waiting for? You've had eleven years more than I did to figure all
> this out and act, what have you been doing? Waiting for Harry to grow up and
> do your job for you?"[^210915-2]

Dumbledore was approximately 100 years old when [Riddle][TMR1] disappeared that
Halloween in 1981.  If he was [too tired][ADi] to deal with things, he should
have retired.  If he was not going to retire, then he *should have acted.*  The
whole [Riddle][TMR1] situation [reeks][ADdwr].

### On titles

The quotes attributed to the Oracle of Delphi in _[The Greater
Will](https://archiveofourown.org/works/16234799)_ put it
well:[^200720-1]

> “Power is always useless when it is just possessed, merely collected
like a bauble. The honors were meant for a protector. One must wonder
how you ended up with them.”[^200720-6]

> “Mimicry may be the highest form of flattery,” she replied
pointedly, “but mockery is just an insult. Goodness is not served by
denying innocents their rightful protections in order to advance your
own agenda. Goodness is not served by denying justice to those who have
been wronged in order to purchase personal favors to be named at a later
date. Goodness is not served when knowledge is hidden and innovation
stifled in order to preserve the oppression which allows you to keep ahold
of all your worthless titles and stolen honors. You are not a good man,
Albus, warlock of Britannia.”[^200720-7]

> “Warlock fits you better than you know,” she stated in echoing
tones. “The wizards of Britannia claimed it as a martial title for
honoring feats of battle, but it has a far older meaning to Mother
Magic, as a title for those who had forsaken their oaths of fidelity and
protection, just as you have done.” She sliced her hands through the
air as he opened his mouth to refute that accusation. “You will not
attempt to spin your inaction as anything but a betrayal. A false show
of humility is not a valid excuse for not using the authority granted
to you in order to serve the needs of the people who trusted you to act
in their best interests over your personal desires. If you truly did
not believe you could be trusted with the power imbued in the roles,
you should have passed them to another who could.”[^200720-8]

Interestingly, Wikipedia confirms that "Warlock" does in fact imply
both male magic user and betrayer.[^200720-2] This contrasts
interestingly with "witch,"[^200720-3] "wizard"[^200720-4] and
"sorcerer"[^200720-5] that apparently have an etymology of simply being
a magic user.  Any work trying to work in the [Harry] Potter universe has
to go fictional at some point, since in true history magic is always
associated with the pagan, the satanic, or both.  So it is noteworthy
that the common titles they use, "witch" and "wizard," have no negative
connotation outside of theology and theologically influenced culture,
but that "warlock" would be used as a title when it does.  My guess is
that Mrs. Rowling though did _not_ do this on purpose.  It is merely
an interesting coincidence that the Wizengamot would chose "warlock"
as one of its leadership positions.

### Vision for Society

So far I have primarily focused on what did Dumbledore know when, what should he
have known when, and his use of power.  I have only touched on his actual goals.
If we agree with his goals, then his ineffectual leadership is a problem.  If we
disagree with his goals then his ability to persuade and delude people is a
problem.  There are few circumstances in which both are ever simultaneously a
problem.  Arguably the two wars precipitated by [Riddle][TMR1] are,
unfortunately, just such an event.

We know very little about the actual authority of the Chief Warlock, the Supreme
Mugwump, or the Hogwarts Headmaster.  What is the relationship, in modern times,
between the Wizengamot and the Ministry of Magic?  Is the Chief Warlock like the
Speaker in the Muggle House of Commons?  If so the power is real, minimal, and
subtle.[^200812-1] i In a similar vein, what is the relationship between the
Headmaster (or mistress) and the Hogwarts Board of Governors?  What powers does
each have?  What discretion does each have?  Does each have distinct areas of
authority, or is it more like the relationship between the president of a
company and the board of directors?  I think even in the corporate world that
different companies have different answers to this question based on the way
they are chartered, so I cannot begin to guess how a school founded in the tenth
century might operate.  The ICW is even more mind boggling.

All this means that the pages I've devoted to trying to guess what Dumbledore
could or could not have accomplished is largely guessing.

We know that Dumbledore was friends with [Gellert Grindelwald][GG].[^200812-2]  He
broke with [Grindelwald][GG], and the precise nature of and grounds for their break
are unknown and unclear.  However, it seems clear to me that it was his sister
that was the straw that broke the camel's back, not a philosophical difference.
Dumbledore could not accompany [Grindelwald][GG], and never would be able
to.[^200812-3]  [Ariana] died sometime around 1898, based on Albus being born in
1881 and being 17 when she died.[^200812-4]  Assuming [Grindelwald][GG]'s defeat
roughly coincides with the end of World War II in Europe, then Dumbledore
finally confronts him in May of 1945, some 47 years later.  That is a phenomenal
amount of time for Dumbledore to have allowed [Grindelwald][GG] to go unchecked if
they actually disagreed.  I have not seen them, but apparently part of the reason
for the Fantastic Beasts prequel movies is to explain this inaction.[^200812-5] I
will not give credence to this late addition to the time line.

More interesting is the question that is implicitly raised in _the Deathly
Hallows_ itself.  If [Grindelwald][GG] has the "unbeatable" Elder Wand, how does
Dumbledore defeat him in a duel?  He is famous for the duel, so one would think
it would be well established as part of the historical record.  If so, then the
power of the Hallows is already broken, and he need not have the elaborate plot
with [Snape][SS] to ensure that he (Dumbledore) dies undefeated.  The wand has already
been defeated.  This makes me think that there is something to Rita's claims
that there was in fact no duel.[^200812-6]

Why lie about having duelled [Grindelwald][GG]?  To paraphrase Dumbledore himself, I am
now leaving the few facts I have for the murky grounds of speculation.
[Grindelwald][GG] had become notorious, the outcry against him was such that their
joint ideas for society were never going to gain ground under his leadership.
Even if [Grindelwald][GG] won the war, his government had no popular support, and
would not stand.  Dumbledore could see that even if [Grindelwald][GG] either could
not or would not.  That is a far cry from actually disagreeing.

On the other hand Dumbledore himself was a half blood.[^200812-7]  I think his
blood status was too well known for him to get significant power in the pure
blood dominated society of the early 1900s.[^220916-3]  He wouldi not become
Headmaster until the 1960s or early 1970s, I suspect he had been passed over at
least once.  It was his defeat of Grindelwald that gave him the stature to
overcome his background and gain ground in the Wizengamot, to have become
Headmaster at all, to have become Supreme Mugwump.

[^220916-3]: I am unsure I believe Muriel and Rita about Kendra having lied
   about her blood status.  If she did, I am unsure it would have worked.  If
   she did not, it only supports my argument.

So if Dumbledore was going to advance the future that he and [Grindelwald][GG] had
mapped out in their youth, or at least the version of it that Dumbledore wanted
(since they disagreed to some extent), the power of the old guard had to be
broken.

But what would replace it?  Democracy is a poor choice from Dumbledore's
perspective.  He has never trusted people, but has grown up in an atmosphere of
secrets and lies.[^200812-8]  He alone is intelligent enough to see what must
be done for the good of all.  Sacrifices must be made, and the muggle born cannot
be trusted to realise that their families must be subjugated.  Dumbledore has
done home visits.  Sure he has seen situations like that of [Riddle][TMR1], but he has
also seen situations like the Grangers or the Creeveys.  Muggle born cannot be
trusted to understand the dangers muggles pose.  Future girls like Ariana must
be safe. Magical blood, those of magical ability, are much more valuable to
society then some mere muggles.  Who knows what the muggle born would vote for!
Why, they might want to give muggles rights!

[Air Elemental]: https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11995519/

So if not democracy, what do we replace it with?  This is where fan fiction
goes all over the place.  Has Dumbledore been removing classes from the
Hogwarts curriculum?  Has he used the ICW to ensure other schools do the same,
or perhaps other longstanding agreements among European schools?  Has he
manipulated the student population more directly?  Set up one student for
failure, another for success?  A love potion here, a compulsion spell there?
Has he embezzled funds?  Blocked attempts at teaching muggleborns about the
wizarding world, or the wizarding world about muggle society?  I think that is
what I like most about _[Air Elemental][]_, Dumbledore is subtle,
[McGonagall][MM], [Sprout][PS] and [Flitwick][FF] realise only after decades
that Dumbledore is prejudiced and does not in fact want muggleborns to fit
in.[^200813-3]  He does not subvert the Goblins, he simply trusts their nature
not to tell a wizard about something he or she does not ask about (other
vaults).  [Harry] *is* missing critical information about the society
around him, but its effects are such that you can see the connection to the way
the books turned out (with a few exceptions like [Ron][RBW]).  There is a
hidden (non-Gringotts) vault full of stuff that book [Harry] might well
never have found, but which you can picture actually existing.  Subtle,
understated manipulations that let people fool themselves.  That I think is a
very very canonical representation of Dumbledore.

What about the Wizengamot?  Has he really done nothing with his seat?  Or has
he played off one faction against another, manipulated people behind the
scenes?  Is his public face at all related to his private goals?
