A recurring theme in fanfiction is Dumbledore's inaction.  Not only is this a
theme in fanfiction, I question it time and time again as Dumbledore [interacts
with Riddle][Dealing_with_Riddle], with [Harry][HJP1] and the [Dursleys][DF1]
, and even with [Grindelwald].  Dumbledore has three jobs, each of which is
the sort of prestigious position that influences a signature line of a
letter, in some cases even when *someone else* is signing the letter in
question.[^211015-1]  What does he do with these positions to shape society?
How does he use them to advance reform, battle injustice, or steer the
wayward towards the light? Is the sum total of his accomplishments in his
tenure as Headmaster at [Hogwarts] that he allowed one werewolf to be educated?
Were there no other were-children in the many years he was there?

Some fanfiction works that have built on this team:

* on the idea that [Hogwarts] should offer languages because while pure-bloods
  might learn a second language at home, not every student at the school has
  that opportunity.
* secondly on the idea that [Bill Weasley] can be trusted to investigate the
  curse on the defence position, since [Dumbledore][AD1] has *already* trusted him to
  help with the wards on [Harry][HJP1]'s house (in this story).

> Albus was truly dumbfounded. He wasn't used to being talked to in the manner

> He had been offering empty promises for so long he had quit trying to actually
> do anything about the problems.[^211015-2]

> For several years now I have been silently observing everything and anything
> that takes place at Hogwarts. And every time I noticed something wrong, I
> often spent many restless nights thinking of how the problems could be fixed
> and the issues could be solved.
>
> But it became obvious to me early on, after first year was over, that
> Dumbledore wasn't going to be interested in fixing these issues until
> _**after**_ Voldemort was gone. And the longer this lasted, the longer
> Dumbledore kept reacting to Voldemort's plans instead of trying to prevent
> them, the more I grew to resent him.
>
> Over and over again I saw evidence that the man would just let Voldemort do
> whatever he wanted.
>
> Over and over again I saw the teachers just follow the man's example without
> questioning the wrongness of it all.
>
> Over and over again, it was up to me and my friends to do the job of the
> staff, to save and protect the students that were their responsibility.
>
> Over and over again my friends and I were rewarded for our efforts, but the
> teachers also neglected to think of how these events might have scarred
> us.[^211102-1]
