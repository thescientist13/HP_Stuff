### Analysis

## Speculation

### Sending [Snape][] to the Shack

I cannot count nor even begin to compile a list of references to the many
places I have read that one or another character justified distrust of Sirius
on the fact that Sirius sent [Snape][] to his death down the tunnel between the
Whomping Willow and the Shrieking Shack.  Everyone acts as if [Snape][] was
tricked into a life or death situation.  If that were true, then Sirius
certainly bears heavy responsibility. *But is that credible?*

As I discuss in my extended look at [Snape's Worst Memory][SWM], I do not
believe that it *is* credible.  [Lupin][] admits that [Snape][] had been
investigating the trips out out of the castle for some time.  [Lily][] states
that she "knows [his] theories" connecting [Lupin][] and the full moon
*despite* knowing only rumours of [Snape][] having met a life threatening
situation in the tunnel.  Given this is all happening in the space of a few
days, we have one of two options.

1. Despite being constrained to keep secret about [Lupin][]'s status, [Snape][]
   has gone on at such length that in one or two days [Lily][] is already sick
   and tired of hearing his *theories* **_plural_** about his "supposed" status
   as a werewolf.  Note, she distinctly said "theories" not "theory" in the
   book.  [Snape][] has developed *multiple* theories connecting [Lupin][] to a
   full moon. and [Lily][] is tired of hearing about it.
2. [Snape][] has been developing these *multiple* theories **for some time**.
   Presenting them to [Lily][] has gained some urgency in the last few days now
   that at least one of them has been proven right, but this is not a new
   topic.  [Lily][] is still tired of hearing about it.

I find the second of these far more likely, though admittedly, both fit the
canonical facts.  So the most likely scenario is something like this:

[Snape][] started insinuating that he already knows what is going on.  He is
goading Sirius precisely the way we see happen during Order of the Phoenix
meetings.[^230206-1]  Sirius made a comment along the lines of "if you want to
meet one, go down and ..." giving directions to access the tunnel.  The thing
is, if [Snape][] believed his own theories, *why did he go?*  Why would you
take advice from an enemy about meeting a dangerous creature?  Conversely from
Sirius' perspective, who would think that [Snape][] *would* actually go down
the tunnel the night of a full moon?

Sure, I can believe that Sirius was probably not very *upset* that [Snape][]
almost died, but that would be in part because of his own dark upbringing, and
in part because Sirius would *blame [Snape][]* for the situation.  More, Sirius
would *resent* being blamed, when he, rightly, would question who in their
right mind, having made comments similar to those [Snape][] had been making,
would have ever gone down the tunnel!

### Effects of Azkaban

Sirius spent twelve years in Azkaban.  We are told that most prisoners go mad
within weeks, and to drain a wizard of his/her powers.[^210630-1]  What effects
did this experience have on Sirius?  He believes that he never lost his mind
because the thought of his own innocence was not a happy thought, and keeping
that thought kept him sane,[^210630-2] and that later, hearing about [Peter][]
created an obsession within him, one that cleared his mind and gave him
strength.[^210630-3]

[Peter]: <../../pettigrew/peter>

A fogged mind and reduced magic for twelve years sounds like, whatever [Harry][]
thinks in at various times in the book, he was in fact affected by the
experience.  This kind of long term trauma *might* have long term effects on his
mental state.  Additionally, we do not know how much wizards depend on their
magic for their overall health.  If his magic was suppressed by his depression,
would that have long term health consequences as well?

One possibility:
> "He was in desperate need of a mind healer after twelve years in Azkaban and
> another one spent as a dog. … If it was only some psychological trauma he
> could visit from time to time or even find someone in Britain, but he suffered
> brain damage from everything he went through. Dementors are not gentle when
> they pillage through your brain. Sirius needs to take more than a dozen
> potions each day and while I'm a certified healer my knowledge about head
> injuries boils down to detecting them and fetching a mind healer."
>
> "Can we visit?"
>
> "I am not sure. He'll be unconscious for most of the treatment so he might
> spend the next three months in an induced coma while the potions do their
> magic," the older witch said[^210630-4]

A second possibility:
> Dementors fed on happy memories. That was what they did. When you spent any amount of time in Azkaban, they sucked your happy memories out of you. You could recover them, of course. It was possible to entirely recover from even an extended trip to Azkaban, in fact, given time and support and a great deal of chocolate, but the key word there was time. Nearly a full year had passed between when Sirius escaped from Azkaban and when Harry had met him, during which time Sirius had been propelled entirely or almost entirely by hatred of Wormtail. Harry's parents were probably the subject of Sirius' worst memory, the image of them lying dead which (having been among Snape's memories) haunted Harry as well. Them he could not forget, any more than he could forget his raging need for Peter Pettigrew to be dead. That wasn't a happy memory. But Harry? Harry had been one year old when Sirius lost him, a tiny ball of green-eyed joy who chased James' cat on his toy broomstick and couldn't pronounce 'Moony' properly. Harry would probably have been, in his entirety, a happy memory ...[^230203-1]

### Lack of a trial

Why was Sirius denied a trial?  More, how was it *possible* to deny him a
trial?  It is reasonable to accept that [Lupin][] both believed him guilty and
would have been unable to demand a trial.  Why, however, did none of
[Dumbledore][], [Andromeda][] Black, or his own blood family demand a trial?

[Harry]: <../../potter/harry_james>

[Lupin]: <../../lupin/remus_john>

[Dumbledore]: <../../dumbledore/albus_percival_wulfric_brian>

[Andromeda]: <../andromeda>

Lets start with the easy ones:  [Arcturus][], [Pollux][], and [Walburga][]
Black.  We know that [Walburga][] hated her son, enough to want him disowned.
We further know, because Sirius inherited number 12 Grimmauld Place, that
neither [Orion][] (died 1979) nor [Arcturus][] Black (died 1991) did
so.[^210517-3]  However, we can infer the following from the fact that they
*also* did not disown [Bellatrix][] and [Regulus][] Black:
* they at very least were not opposed to [Riddle][]'s pure-blood terrorism
* they probably (given what we know of Walburga at least) supported [Riddle][]
* they cared more about the survival of the name Black than Sirius' beliefs

[Arcturus]: <../arcturus_II>

[Pollux]: <../pollux>

[Walburga]: <../walburga>

[Orion]: <../orion>

[Bellatrix]: <../bellatrix>

[Regulus]: <../regulus_arcturus>

[Riddle]: <../../riddle/tom_marvolo>

My guess is that they held themselves apart from actually joining the Death
Eaters, and thus did not *know* that Sirius had not joined.  They saw his
incarceration thus as being one of two alternatives:
* he is guilty and thus they could at last be somewhat proud of him
* he is innocent and thus continues to be a disgrace.

Given that, I believe they would find the lack of a trial almost palatable, they
would somewhat fear to find out which alternative is true.  If he is in fact
guilty, then when [Riddle][] returns (which they *probably* expected, the
[Malfoy][] family certainly seems to have expected it) then he would be freed
from Azkaban.  If he was innocent, then it is a shame the family name would die
out, but better that no one know their shame (that Sirius is a blood traitor).

Thus they were essentially betting on the odds that Sirius was both in fact
guilty (and thus the trial would not help him) and that [Riddle][] would return
before Sirius died, thus giving him (Sirius) an opportunity to
procreate.[^210517-4]

Why did [Andromeda][] not demand a trial?  My guess is that she falls
sufficiently into the "trust [Dumbledore][]" category that she believes his
testimony about the betrayal even if the only evidence of her Order membership
is the use of her house as a safe house.[^210517-5]

What about [Dumbledore][]?  It really comes down to what did he know when.  Was
anything said in the Potter wills?  We do not know. Did he have any indication,
from [Snape][] for example, that [Pettigrew][] was in fact the traitor?  Again,
we do not know.  This *might* be simply [Dumbledore][] not caring to use
political capital to ensure a trial that should not change anything (Sirius if
guilty would have still gone to Azkaban).

Lastly, it is entirely possible that there *was* other evidence beyond
[Dumbledore][]'s testimony against Sirius.  Sirius was imprisoned not just for
the betrayal of the Potters, but primarily for the murder of *[Peter
Pettigrew][]*.  **If** Sirius *did* cast a spell during that confrontation, he
might well have *thought* he *had* succeeded.  In other words, [Peter][] might
well have tricked not only the Ministry, but Sirius as well.[^221202-4]  Sirius
says that [Peter][] cut off the finger and blew up the street,[^221202-5] but
that could mean before his curse *landed* rather than before it was *cast*.

[^221202-4]: This line of reasoning from comes from "[Abandoning Ship][]" by
    Red Hen Publications.  I am not sure how much I am convinced by it, but it
    does have a certain persuasiveness.

[^210517-4]: Some writers have speculated that long term exposure to dementors
    would affect virility, fertility, or both.   I am unaware of any cannon
    reason to believe this.

### Sirius as Godparent

Does Sirius recognise that [Harry][] is not [James][] reincarnated?  Is he an
adrenaline junkie, or can he help [Harry][] learn to make mature decisions
about dangerous situations?  Is the antagonism with [Snape][] due to hatred for
one whose loyalty he suspects might in fact be towards [Riddle][], or is it
evidence that he remains the immature bully he admits he was a
youth?[^210519-11]  In short, does Sirius deserve the censure that [Molly][]
and [Hermione][] at times level upon him?  Much of this hinges on the [effects
of Azkaban][].
