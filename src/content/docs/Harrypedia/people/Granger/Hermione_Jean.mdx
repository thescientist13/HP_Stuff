### Analysis

#### Relating to other people's analysis

[An old post][The_Half_Blood_Prince] reminds me that it has been so long since
I first read the Harry Potter books that I cannot really trust my memories of my
first impressions.  Whatever I may once have thought, as I have come to think
more deeply about the series, Hermione is no longer one of my favourite characters.  I think that is why when I first started reading fan fiction I was
so strongly drawn to the cannon [Harry]/[Ginny] pairing.  Of the female characters in the books, few get consistently positive portrayals, and of those, only [Harry] only *really* relates to Hermione, [Ginny], and [Luna].  [Ginny] and [Luna] are long enough topics to deserve their own pages.  

[Luna]: <../../lovegood/luna>

[The_Half_Blood_Prince]: https://www.schierer.org/~luke/log/fiction/Harry_Potter/The_Half_Blood_Prince/

I do not think I really started to understand why I was reacting against
Hermione though until I started to read that class of fan fiction where
characters are reading their own books.  I think it was reading other people's
reactions to Hermione framed through this media that allowed my thoughts to
finally codify.

Then, when I started writing these [Notes], I find that someone has come
before me and done a sufficient job ranting about the way Mrs. Rowling failed
to call Hermione to account[^200706-3] that I would struggle to do better. If
that is not enough, in some ways, [this][TSWoHA] fake interview for a position
in the Department of Mysteries does even better.[^210324-2]

[Notes]: </harrypedia>

Based on an interview she quotes, Ms. Onim asserts that Hermione is essentially
a very flat character with the emotional maturity of a very young (she gives
her credit for fourteen in one place, before pointing out a temper tantrum more
appropriate for a four year old) girl.[^200706-4] I am not sure I would go
quite that far; I think that Hermione does grow some over the course of the series.  

#### Hermione and Harry

I do think that Mrs. Rowling became, to an extent, a victim of her own success
with the latter half of the series, from approximately Goblet of Fire on.  And
thus I do agree that she (Mrs. Rowling) was probably lazy and used Hermione to
provide information that would have better come from [Ron], or to solve
situations that [Harry] could better have handled.  It is odd that the
prophesy speaks of one who would be [Riddle]'s equal, but that [Harry] is,
in many ways, carried along right up to the last scene in the Great Hall.  

[Riddle]: <../../riddle/tom_marvolo>

On the other hand, he need not have been.  Where did [Harry] and Hermione
disagree?  

* They disagreed over the Firebolt, call that one a draw - it did come
  from [Black], but it was safe.  Hermione here acts from the best of
  motives, she wants to keep her friend safe.  I have no problems with *why*
  she acted, but *how*.  Was it necessary to go behind [Harry]'s back the way
  she did?  She makes one essentially yelled out assertion that the broom could
  have come from him, and when [Harry] does not immediately agree, she goes
  and reports to [Professor McGonagall].  I can see that most teens would be
  uncomfortable calling in authority this way, and thus that very few if any
  would have informed [Harry] in advance that they intended to do so.  The
  part that concerns me is two fold.  One, she did not really try to convince
  him at all.  When you read the series through the first time this does not
  really stand out, but if you look at it holistically, it is part of a pattern
  where she expects people to follow her advice as superior to their own ideas.
  Secondly, she does not empathise with him at all.  I get that she dislikes
  both sports in general and flight in particular.  She should however be able
  to recognise that [Harry] disagrees, and is not wrong to do so.  
* They disagreed over the rescue in 5th year.  Hermione was right, but she
  handled it badly.  Here I am mostly inclined to give Hermione a total pass,
  she was 16 and in over her head dealing with an adult situation.
* They disagreed over [Malfoy] as a death eater.  [Harry] was right.  I
  have read at least one fan fiction where Hermione eventually admits that she
  was, in sixth year, scared.[^210818-1]  It is also possible that she is
  reacting to the way that [Ron] and [Harry] blamed [Malfoy] second year,
  when he was, that time, innocent.[^210818-2]  Either way, it is clear that
  she is not *really* considering anything [Harry] says about [Malfoy] over
  the course of this year (In her defence, neither does anyone else).  In retrospect we know that this is because of [Dumbledore]'s overconfidence.[^210818-3]  Either she is in denial (understandable, but unacceptable from someone lauded as being strong), or she was massively, stupidly, overly confident in authority to the point of abdicating responsibly for her own life and safety.  If the former, she is a very human character, but not someone [Harry] can really depend on.   If the latter, she is not actually intelligent.  
* They disagreed over going to Godric's Hollow.  Again a draw - it was a trap,
  but there was a horcrux there that could have been destroyed if they had
  planned better. 
* They disagreed over a Horcrux in Hogwarts.  [Harry] was right.  If Hermione
  had her way, the war would *never* have ended.  It is worth pointing out here
  that, per [Harry]'s vision of [Dumbledore] at King's Cross, his plan in
  having her accompany [Harry] was for her to *slow him down*.[^230208-1]
* They disagreed over the Hollows.  Both were right at different times.  She 
  was right to pursue them initially when he didn't want to, but she was very quick to give up on them after learning what they are, whereas he became very interested in them until much later.  We are unsure over the importance of being Master of Death, so we cannot be sure how to call this one.
* They disagree over House Elves.  We lack the information to call this one.
* They disagree over the potions book.  Despite the use of Sectumsempra, I think
  [Harry] was right on this one.   Certainly Hermione's *reasoning* was wrong even if her conclusion was partially correct.

[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]: https://www.librarything.com/work/3577382

Overall, the list has Hermione unambiguously right one time, [Harry] unambiguously right 3 times, and the point contested between them another three times (one time we cannot judge where it falls).  In other words, if [Harry] had been allowed to stand up to Hermione, he could have been allowed to show case his own reasoning skills and to have taken charge more.  He would then have been more of the leader, more of [Riddle]'s equal.

#### Crookshanks 

But that's almost an aside.  The real thing that upsets me is the stuff that is
covered in that essay, plus the fact that if you pay attention in _[Prisoner of
Azkaban]_, Hermione is in fact incredibly insensitive.  I am not faulting her
for buying Crookshanks.  She is not obligated to avoid owning a cat just because
[Ron] owns a rat.  Hedwig should have been just as prone to attacking
Scabbers as Crookshanks, the reality of the pets chosen for Hogwarts is that
some of them are predators of others of them. Owls eat small cats if they can,
cats eat small owls if they can.  Both will kill toads if they are given a
chance.  Rats aren't even on the approved list, probably precisely because the
two most common pets will so commonly hunt them. 

[Prisoner of Azkaban]: https://www.librarything.com/work/2742161/book/225886376

The problem is not her choice of pet, the problem is her attitude.  Hermione is
heedless and uncaring.  Sure it is natural that Crookshanks would hunt Scabbers.
*So why would Hermione carry him into the boy's dorm with her?* We never hear of
any other cats wandering around the common room, any of which would be equally
likely to attack Scabbers.  Presumably these other cats are kept contained in
dorm rooms when their owners are not actively playing with them.  Why is
Hermione never held responsible for Crookshanks' habit of wandering around
campus? Sure Mrs. Noris does, but are there really only two cats in Hogwarts
when it is one of the three approved pets? I think it far more likely that all
the other cats are *kept contained.*  Strange cats would fight if they were not
kept relatively segregated.  Alternately, perhaps magical cat pets are normally
abnormally well behaved.  If that is the case, Crookshanks is *quite* the
exception, and Hermione should have been called to *do something* about it, or
send him home.  Worse, while she does burst into tears now and then, she never
does express sorrow for the pain her cat has caused [Ron].  If my cat ate my
best friend's pet, I might not blame the cat, but I would apologise for
allowing it to happen. 

Remember what I said about the firebolt being part of a pattern? Consider this a second data point.  Hermione *never* admits fault, and is *never* called on her faults.  

#### Veela (and Fleur in particular)

It really comes down to the same thing when you look at Hermione's reaction to
[Fleur Delacour].  The girls at Hogwarts universally hate [Fleur] because
the boys are universally attracted to her.  Honestly, this is one thing that I
have trouble with about [Ginny], but it is even worse for Hermione to be
falling into this trap.  [Fleur] is part Veela, and males unconsciously and
*against their will* react to Veela.  Sure, with sufficient will power they can
resist, but Mrs. Rowling makes it seem that any male that lacks that level of
will power is to be despised.  I am sorry, if a Veela's power is to mean
anything, the ability to resist it cannot be common.  If the ability to resist
it is *un*common, then you should not despise or deride a guy just because he
lacks that ability.  We might admire someone's photographic memory, but we are
not going to ridicule someone who lacks it.  In point of fact, this fits with
what Mrs. Rowling writes - [Fleur] is attracted to [Bill] *because* he is
that rare male who does not react.  This has been so rare in her life as to
stand out.  

[Fleur Delacour]: <../../delacour/fleur_isabelle>

[Fleur]: <../../delacour/fleur_isabelle>

[Bill]: <../../weasley/william_arthur>

Hermione researches *everything* impulsively.  She might not have known much
about Veela at the world cup, but after seeing the guys react to them there,
she would have read about them in the Hogwarts library.  She would have known
that [Ron]'s reaction was involuntary.  What [Fleur] is doing is roughly
equivalent to the imperious curse.  Read the description from the World Cup and
then read the description from the false Moody's lesson.  They are not
precisely the same, but the similarities are very very real.  [Harry]
describes both as a pleasant feeling that makes it hard to think, hard to
consider disagreeing, makes him *want* to go long.  It would not surprise me if
Veela were considered "dark" creatures,[^200707-1] and there would be good
reason for it.  [Fleur] is not evil, she dislikes the effect she has on the
males around her, and a "dark" creature would either not care or would active
revel in her power over the helpless males.  You could, however, understand a
government that either did not make this fine distinction, or who judged the
entire race of Veela based on the action of a subset who *did* abuse the ability. 

Hermione might not have liked that [Ron] did react, but she would have known
all of this back story.  She should have either despised [Fleur] as an evil
dark creature and have given [Ron] a pass, or she would recognise that
[Fleur] dislikes the effect, and champion her as a misunderstood and
oppressed magical species just as she does the house elves.  If the later, she
would have given [Fleur] a pass.  Blaming both for the effect is basically
displaying the worst of shallow female jealousy.  It is the kind of behaviour
that she would normally ascribe to Pansy.

#### Advice to [Ginny]

Hermione *is* a very shallow female in many ways though, something we see when
we look at the the advice she gives to [Ginny] for dealing with a debilitating crush.  The boy you like is not paying attention to you?  Date some other guys.  The cynical part of me hears this as "Make him jealous." While that approach happens to work in this case, [Harry] *does* get jealous of [Dean], it is not a smart strategy.[^230208-2] 

[^230208-2]: Ms. Davia Sills. "[Inducing Jealousy to Get Your Mate's Attention]"
    _[Psycology Today]_ 2011-11-30.  This is essentially written at a
    lay-person, but it has the citations to back it up.  From my perspective a
    more serious flaw is the secular approach, but for this purpose that might
    actually be better?

[Inducing Jealousy to Get Your Mate's Attention]: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/loves-evolver/201111/inducing-jealousy-get-your-mates-attention

[Psycology Today]: https://www.psychologytoday.com/

[Dean]: <../../thomas/dean>

The jealousy angle aside though, having [Ginny] using dating to build
confidence was both high risk and unfair to the guys [Ginny] dated.  High
risk in that the breakups and rejection that [Ginny] might have faced *in*
those relationships might have destroyed the confidence that Hermione was
hoping to build up.  Unfair in that [Ginny] was entering relationships
*intending* them to be temporary, *intending* to breakup with the guys
eventually when [Harry] someday noticed her.   This might be perfectly good
from pop culture's standpoint, but it is *horrible* morality.   Lastly, high risk (though again pop culture does not recognise this) in that [Ginny] was not going to learn how to have a successful relationship when all of her experience came from experiences she entered into with a mental escape plan. 

#### Hermione's Parents

Hermione's relationship with her own parents is one of the more curious things
in the series.  She seems to spend less and less time with her parents, and by
the summer between sixth and seventh year, is falls into classical magical
thinking.  Her decision to remove her parents memories of having a child
*without consulting them*, however well intentioned, is condescending and
paternalistic - an attitude wholly inappropriate for a daughter/parent
relationship.  Like the incident with the firebolt, her conclusions and thus
actions might in the end be the right ones,[^240101-1] but her reasoning is all wrong.  

Frankly, as a parent, this is the section that utterly horrifies me.  By fourth
year, as a fifteen year old girl,  Hermione has essentially divorced herself
from her parents.  If one of my children were to do that, I would be devastated.
I *understand* that one of the nearly universal fatal flaws of having children
as protagonists in literature is the impossibility of portraying adults
reasonably, but consider this as one of Hermione's parents.  Assume, for the
same of having a series, that [Harry]'s participation in the war is in fact
necessary.  Given that, one can, somewhat reluctantly accept, that the support
Hermione gives him at school is also critical.  As a parent, I would rage
against the dysfunction that has allowed [Harry]'s situation to occur, but I
can accept that it would eventually escalate world wide if not stopped.  When
you cannot flee, you have to stand and fight.

Hermione does not give her parents this chance.  Starting *at age twelve* she
starts censoring all the important details of what happens at school.  That is
totally unacceptable.  No reasonable parent would accept that behaviour.  As a
consequence of this, she feels less and less connected to them.  A reasonable
parent would notice this, and recognise something is wrong.  We are left to
assume that Hermione's parents are so wrapped up in their careers that she can
be absent from home all but a (maybe) a few weeks between her fourth and fifth
year, and they notice so little that they neither demand she come home for
Christmas break, nor that she stay with them the summer after fifth year.

Speaking of which, if Hermione is not explaining things to them, how does she
end up with the Order *all summer*?  It cannot be "for safety" - her parents
have not been told she is in danger.  Again we are seeing a portrayal of
Hermione's parents as essentially neglectful to the point of criminal
negligence.  Our daughter is off with we do not really know who for the entire
summer with no way to contact her.  Oh, and we have not seen her since
early August last year, where we did not talk enough to know anything of
significance about her incredibly stressful school year. 

Then, to cap this pattern, she unilaterally modifies their memories to erase
her own existence, and sends them off to Australia.  Do you really think this
seventeen year old girl with no practical experience in the non-magical world
took adequate care of wrapping up all the loose ends such a move would have in
her parents lives?  This is a really big question if she planned on the move
being essentially permanent, but it is an impossible one if she planned on them
being able to return should the war ever end successfully.  What did she do
with their house, their business, the clientele that business' success is based
on?  Is there any extended family *or even close friends* with whom she is
causing her parents to cut off all contact essentially overnight and without
explanation?  

And it would have to be without explanation.  How could it be otherwise?  Her
parents do not even know their own names.  Having a new identity, *they* cannot
be responsible for mothballing the dental practice, contacting friends or
family, or any of the dozens of details that would need to happen if they are
to go overseas in a way they can hope to return from.  

I am unsure how necessary it was to modify give them a new identity this way.  I
agree they *did* probably need to either go into hiding or leave the country (at
least temporarily).  If I "woke up" from this however, was de-enchanted to find
myself in Australia having had no say in going, I would be massively upset.
The person who caused this would have to admit to having *been wrong to do so* to repair that relationship.  If they do not, how can I trust them?  

### Hermione and Ron

The idea that opposites attract is a common one in pop culture.  I am quite positive that there is at least some truth to it.  It seems equally reasonable that an immature young teen, or better yet, the young pre-teen first experiencing hormones and unsure how to deal with them, might react to the desires they generate by picking a fight to get attention.  It is an extension of the way a child sometimes misbehaves, deciding that negative attention is better than no attention.  

If, however, you do not grow out of this, your relationship is doomed.  That they are, by the end of the series, now 18 years old and yet Hermione and [Ron]
are still pushing each other's buttons and bickering as a first reaction (except when [Ron] feels the need to suck up to her after abandoning them, but that's not healthy either) says nothing good about either one.  

Equally concerning is the way that Hermione sends the canaries to attack [Ron] when she is upset that he has started to date [Lavender].[^240101-2]  The
attack, while not premeditated, is a vicious violet use of magic with intent to harm.  The birds *did* draw blood, cause scarring, and *could* have damaged him more severely (if for example they had reached his eyes while pecking his head).
Without re-reading more recently than I have, I cannot recall if this is before or after Hermione's 17th birthday.  If after, and had [Ron] chosen to press charges (and assuming that [Hogwarts] were the sort of school that were possible - which it is not), she would have been tried as an adult.  In the mundane world, she it would have been one of the charges listed in either the [Offences against the Person Act of 1861] or something that later replaced or amended it.  People would probably be quicker to condemn this relationship violence if it were male on female instead of female on male.  As a thought exercise, imagine that [Ron] had attacked Hermione rather than yelling at her when he was first enraged with jealousy over her relationship with Krum. 

It also isn't the first time that Hermione has attacked someone - the use of the [Confundus] spell on [McLaggen] to help [Ron] win the keep trial must be categorised as an attack as well.[^240417-3]  Once again people are generally willing to forgive her because it is 1) female on male violence 2) against a disliked character 3) results in a favourable outcome 4) done to help someone she has feelings for([Ron]).  None of these *actually* justify her actions. 

[Offences against the Person Act of 1861]: https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/enacted/data.pdf

### Conclusion

Overall it is really easy to fall into a Hermione bashing trap.  I do not want
to do that.  I think Hermione is an eminently redeemable character.  She means
well, is regularly very generous, and highly loyal.  She just needs to learn.
To learn that authority can fail you, both books and teachers.  To learn that
she might be very intelligent, but she is can still make mistakes, and that
sometimes those she regularly corrects will point those mistakes 
out.[^221214-1]  To recognise others strengths and accept competition.  But the
only way she can do that is if she is forced to face consequences.  Not
necessarily world or relationship ending consequences, but she does have to be
called to account.  When she is heartless, she has to face that she's hurt
someone.  When she's wrong, it has to be pointed out.  

[^221214-1]: The author doesn't come out and say it, but old-crow suggests that
	Hermione may have contributed to the problems she faced in Primary school
	in _[Dan Granger]_.  Two wrongs do not make a right, but as an adult
	while I punish both children, I *understand* why a child reacts when pushed
	too far.  Hermione, with her superior attitude, no doubt did quite a bit of
	(verbal) pushing.

Sometimes that means that you lose a friend, perhaps (hopefully) only
temporarily, but sometimes permanently.  I would hope that Hermione and
[Harry] would recover from the break in their relationship that should have
happened in third year.  If it did not happen then, I do not think they would
have time (in the books we see) for them to recover from the events of sixth
year, though it is anyone's guess which specific event would be one too many.
