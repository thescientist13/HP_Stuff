## Peverell Brothers

"The Tale of the Three Brothers" as quoted in Chapter 21 of _the Deathly
Hallows_ gives us the most truly cannon information on the three
brothers.[^20210125-1]  It does not give us any real indication of how old the
brothers were when the artefacts were either made or acquired, but if you read
carefully, there are some clues about their lives.  

* The first brother is described as dying within a few weeks. He "travelled on
  for a week or more" before reaching the village in which he died.[^20210125-2]

* The second brother "journeyed to his own home, where he lived
	alone."[^20210125-3] The wording is technically ambiguous, bit implies that he
	summoned the shade of "the girl he had once hoped to marry, before her
	untimely death"[^20210125-4] immediately on arriving home.  It concludes that
	he was "finally" driven to despair, implying time has passed.  It seems to me
	unlikely though that a man obsessed with the stone in this way would marry and
  have children.  Interestingly, the editor at the lexicon seems to
  agree.[^20210423-1]  Yes, I know that the Gaunts claim to be
  descendants,[^20210304-1] I am not however the first to realise that the ring
	is not precisely proof.[^20210218-1]

* "Death searched for the third brother for many years," ... "he had attained a
  great age" and had a son.[^20210125-5]  Cannon sources tell us that the Potter
  family would descend from a granddaughter (of some number of generations) of
  this brother.  I know it flies in the face of accepted interpretation, but I
  insist that if the Gaunts are true decedents of the Peverells at all, and not
  false claimants, then they must also descend from this brother.  I believe
  that the third brother alone lived to raise a family.  

## The Deathly Hallows

The three brothers are said to have left three artefacts, a wand, a stone, and
an invisibility cloak.  While the invisibility cloak figures across all seven
books, it is really only in the last book that we truly encounter the other two.
Again, information is inconclusive.  I forget which fanfiction author I first
encountered the idea in, but I see merit in considering that these artefacts may
not be as simple as they first appear. That author had Harry, some time after
the Battle of Hogwarts, ask the question, would his parents have been so
accepting, almost encouraging, if they had *truly* been present on his walk into
the forest?  Was the stone presenting him with false images of those he loved to
lead him towards suicide? 

More recently I came across another work that may be going in a similar direction. 

> Dumbledore looked up at Mrs. Weasley suddenly. Harry saw the movement. *"Expelliarmus!"*
> 
> A half dozen other spells flashed around the room. With the grace of a Seeker,
> Harry grabbed the wand that flew towards him. Dumbledore was hit by two red

> "Harry, no!" Sirius had tried to stop him.

> Harry took the wand and snapped it over his knee.<
>

A wand that feels of "unclean power."  This story is still in progress, it
remains to be seen where the author will go with the concept, but the idea is
certainly suggestive.  A wand that corrupts its user does sound like something
that might have been given to that eldest brother by a figure claiming to be
death, jealous of their continued existence.  

Countering this idea is the Potter family's long association with the cloak,
which does not seem to have harmed them, and *does* seem to be beneficial.
Perhaps the difference lies in that the stone and the wand were crafted on the
spot for the brothers, whereas the cloak was a pre-existing artefact given them
by "Death."  Perhaps the difference lies in that the first two requests were
essentially selfish and prideful ones, whereas the third brother acted in
humility.[^20210226-2]
