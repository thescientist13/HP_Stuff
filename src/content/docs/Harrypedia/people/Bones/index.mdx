[Susan] Bones' grandparents are the ones killed by
[Riddle].[^210301-1] She lost an uncle, aunt, and
cousins to one of the ten death eaters freed during _Order of the
Phoenix_.[^210519-10]  She is [listed][ClassLists] as being a halfblood,
despite coming from a family with enough influence that her Aunt is head of the
[DMLE][Culture].[^210701-1] How close is Susan's relationship with her Aunt?
Is [Amelia][] a traditionalist even if she also believes in justice?[^210701-2]
Or is [Amelia][] fairly broad minded?[^210701-3]

[^210701-3]: This view of [Amelia] is shown in Fibinaci's _[Padfoot, Docteur
    D'amour](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4510080)_.

[^210701-2]: This idea puts [Susan] at odds with her [aunt][Amelia] in VonPelt's _[Her
    Finest Hour](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13654352/1/Her-Finest-Hour)_.

[^210701-1]: I do not think you can advance *that high* in the Ministry without
    influence.  That might be political influence, familial influence, or the
    kind you get from knowing everyone's dirty laundry.
