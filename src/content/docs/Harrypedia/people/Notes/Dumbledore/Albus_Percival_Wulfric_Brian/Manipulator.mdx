It is quite easy to portray [Dumbledore][AD1] as a master
manipulator.[^211203-1]  Indeed, for a fan fiction author, the problem with
this route is not that [Dumbledore][AD1] ends up feeling Out of Character, but
rather that there seems to be a dissociative element to the story if you allow
anything to go *better* than it did in the cannon story line.  How could
[Harry][HJP1] overcome [Dumbledore][AD1] with his decades of experience at
subtle manipulations? Ian Hycrest, writing as Kingsley, describes this sort of
[Dumbledore][AD1] thus:

> It's difficult to try to put into words just how much we all trusted and
> relied on Albus Dumbledore. He was our leader, our counselor, our guide. For
> decades, he had shaped magical society, to the point that to many people, the
> idea of defying him was unimaginable. And yet, he was careful to never be too
> overt, at least not until the end. All it required was a word here, a
> suggestion there… and like the master manipulator that he was, Dumbledore
> ensured that no one truly knew how much he did behind the scenes.
> 
> His was a soft power, subtly swaying those who held actual authority to follow
> his chosen path. Still, with such a wide base of people who were convinced
> that he could do no wrong, he was able to wield an astounding amount of
> influence, ensuring that things went as he desired. His suggestions were
> treated like divine guidance. Looking back, we should have been more
> suspicious. We should have questioned why someone who had such power didn't
> use it to solve the corruption he claimed to oppose. We should have asked why
> he felt the need to meddle in matters that were, quite frankly, none of his
> business. But at the time, that was just the way that things were.

> Perhaps the most disturbing thing is how people responded when his

> failed and he had to take direct action, or when his 'innocent' ideas
> produced an outcome that no sane person could possibly accept, Dumbledore
> would play the part of the weary old man, weighed down by cares, struggling
> to do his best against forces beyond his control. And like fools, we all
> believed him.  How could we have been so blind?[^20210629-1]

One might use the fact that he was evicted as Headmaster in Book 2, or from his
various positions in Book 5 as counter examples to this portrayal.  I disagree.
I am not *wholly* convinced of this view of [Dumbledore][AD1] but I believe it is
*plausible*, and I think the proof of its plausibility is really the
conversation at "Kings Cross" at the end of Book 7.  If [Dumbledore][AD1] really
did chart out [Harry][HJP1]'s course, plan the entire war out to include events
after his own death, as is implied, then he is fully capable of including in his
plan temporary defeats on his own part.  The man who uses his own death that way
would certainly also use his own removal from the ICW, and/or the Wizengamot.  

Allowing himself to appear more fallible, more the victim, would endear him to
[Harry][HJP1].  Being recalled to the position after being vindicated would
make the next removal harder (thus I think he *was* in fact able to resist
Fudge and Umbridge in Book 5 for most of the year).
