### Analysis

Where I end up reluctantly very critical of [Professor McGonagall][McGonagall], 
there is some slight evidence that suggests that Professor Flitwick is redeemable. 

* We know of no examples of an unfair detention from Professor Flitwick.
* We know of no example of Professor Flitwick giving in to the rumours
  surrounding Harry and the Tri-Wizzard Tournament the way both Professors
  [McGonagall] and [Sprout] did. 
* We do know that he utterly neglected [Luna Lovegood][Luna], but that could
  be because she never reported it to him. It is *possible* that under a
  [Dumbledore] regime professor's hands are tied until such matters are
  reported with proof.[^20210322-3] We do not *know* that this is the case, but
  it *could* be, and it *fits*. 
* We do not know if he joined the Order of the Phoenix or not, but we know that
  he did *not* support the Pureblood Supremacists.  Being anti-Dumbledore would
  actually count as a positive in my book, so this could go either way as a
  positive or a negative.
