*Speculation, Analysis and Reference Material for the Harry Potter Universe*

## Introduction to this Reference

I probably still need to revisit the main page and move some of its content here. 

## My Own Sources

I will use the the following, in the following order of precedence.  That is, facts found in secondary sources cannot contradict facts found in primary sources, nor can facts found in tertiary sources contradict either of the previous two. 

### Primary Sources 
Bloomsbury editions, [with corrections][]

[with corrections]: <https://www.hp-lexicon.org/differences-changes-text/>

### Almost Not Quite Primary Sources
American Kindle editions (because these are easier to search and cite).  The distinction matters because the American versions are in fact "translated" and there *are* some differences. 

### Secondary Sources
* [Quidditch Through The Ages](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/111450.Quidditch_Through_the_Ages)

* Other works accepted by the [Rowling Index](https://www.rowlingindex.org/) but
  not otherwise listed on this site.

### Tertiary Sources
