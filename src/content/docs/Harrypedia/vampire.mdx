### Facts

* Considered a dark creature.[^211115-3]
* Unknown if this is a disease like lycanthropy, or if in Harry Potter they are
  a true species.[^211115-4]
* Harry Potter uses the classical aversion to garlic and drinking of
  blood,[^211115-5] but unlike [Dracula][] (the character), we see one being
  fed a pasty.[^211115-6]

### Analysis

How much blood do you have to lose before you become a vampire?

In _[Dracula][]_, any bite causes a loss of willpower, but only actually dying will
cause you to become one.[^210513-6]  Is that true here?  If so, is anything
left of the original person when you change?

It seems to be implied that vampires may not be beings of pure evil.[^210513-7] 
Is this a true or false impression?
