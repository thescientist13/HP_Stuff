Mrs. Rowling seems to have taken folklore of a variety of sea-folk and combined
them into her own form of merpeople.[^211111-3]  As such, the details on these
folk sometimes contradict things you would expect having learned of them from
more standard sources.  Essentially one could posit that what we know of these
creatures is a distorted view of the magical world caused by the confusion
engendered by the Statute of Secrecy.  

Merpeople, as a group, have rejected classification as [beings](../)
despite fully qualifying for such status.[^211111-4]  She seems to have split
them into three races: [Siren](siren), [selkies](selkies), and [merrow](merrow);
native to the Mediterranean, Scotland, and Ireland respectively.[^211111-5] This
fits well with what I read in a recent [Tor][] [article][tbm1] on the variety of
mermaid myths around the world.[^211111-6]
