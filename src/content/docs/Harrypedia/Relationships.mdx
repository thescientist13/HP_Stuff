title: "Relationships the Characters End in"
author: "Luke Schierer"

While my discussion on [Shipping] is focused on how fan fiction has
handled relationships, here I am looking at the relationships that
Mrs. Rowling has ended the series with.  Many of these we know only
from secondary, and tertiary sources.  While this may be less than
satisfying, it is what it is.

Mrs Rowling has established the following:

* [Harry] married [Ginny] at some unknown point.[^HPGW]
  * [Harry] worked as an Auror[^HPJob]
  * [Ginny] initially played for the [Holyhead Harpies]
    and then became an [Quidditch] correspondant.[^GWJob]
* [Ron] married [Hermione] at some unknown point.[^RWHG]
  * [Hermione] worked for the [Ministry].[HGJob]
  * [Ron] initially worked for the Aurors,[^RWJ1] then
    joined [George] at the joke shop.[^RWJob]
* [Neville] married [Hannah Abbott].[^NLHA]
  * [Neville] eventually became Herbology professor.[^NLJob] We are
    unsure what he did before.
  * [Hannah] supposedly applies as matron at [Hogwarts].[^HAJ2]
    She was previously landlady at the Leaky.[^HAJ1]
* [Luna] married [Rolf Scamander]; both are naturalists.[^LSRS]
* [Percy] married the unknown [Audrey].[^PWA]
  * [Percy] ends up head of the Department of Transportation.[^PWJob]
* [Draco] marries [Astoria].[^DMAG]  Of whom Mrs. Rowling says she
  "had gone through a similar (though less violent and frightening)
  conversion from pure-blood ideals to a more tolerant life view."[^AG]

The situation presented is fairly bleak.  I feel somewhat comfortable
with the [Harry]/[Ginny] pairing unless and except you include the
_[Cursed Child]_ play.  If that gets categorized as a fan fiction
work, then my concerns are more limited.  It mostly comes down to the
disconnect between what I would consider an ideal ending and what
secular culture does.  [Harry], whose greatest desire is for family,
must have made many compromises to successfully navigate a
relationship with [Ginny] as she works for the [Harpies].  While I
have no moral qualms about women working, I think that the children
would be impacted with [Harry] and [Ginny] both having very demanding
jobs like this.  In that sense I suppose _[Cursed Child]_ is slightly
more believable.  I do not see, from the outside looking in, the same
level of devotion from [Ginny] to [Harry] that I suspect he must have
for her.  However, the two working parent family is the secular norm,
and from a secular standpoint, of course [Ginny] had to achieve *all*
of her dreams without compromise.  Still, I find it hard to believe
that [Harry] would allow himself to become so disconnected from his
family as _[Cursed Child]_ makes out.

I think that [Ron] and [Hermione] are a disaster waiting to happen.
While I do not believe in divorce, it is almost certain that
[Hermione] would have.  I can only think that unless magic makes
divorce impossible, the two of them would have ended up in that state.
By the epilogue, [Ron] still shows both a characteristic laziness and
a total disregard for both the rights of non-magical people, for their
worth, and for the law.  These are all things that [Hermione] has
dedicated her life to championing.  While I understand the whole
"opposites attack" thing in theory, I do not believe such diverged
personalities could truly work together.

We have only an article that is Mrs. Rowling uses [Rita Skeeter] as
the fictional author when we learn of [Hannah]'s plans to join her
husband at [Hogwarts].  Knowing [Rita], not everything printed is
true, but how much is false, how much is merely exaggerated, and how
much is simply shaded to look bad?  Without independent collaboration
we cannot say.  I am concerned about this relationship.  Either
[Hannah] is going from land lady at the tavern to matron at the school
to stay with her husband, or the two of them will be separated for
large parts of the year by careers that both demand physical presence.
In the first case, was [Hannah] unhappy with her apparent success?
Was she manager but not owner?  If so, giving up the (probably
stressful) job may well be welcome.  If she is owner, she now has to
sell the place or employ someone.  She might well consider the
sacrifice worth while for her husband's dream job.  Perhaps they as a
couple have discussed this in a healthy way.  It just seems, as I
said, odd.

[Draco] has apparently learned little to to nothing from his experience.
He is still attracted to the [dark arts], though wise enough not to
use them.[^DMDA]  Despite my defense of the [Greengrass] family, Mrs.
Rowling's statement is hardly a glowing one.  We can say that their
relationship with the older generation was probably unhappy, and given
that [Draco] was apparently unable or unwilling to give up the
[Malfoy] ways, I suspect their own relationship had some of the same
tension.  Which parent had more influence on young [Scorpius]?  I
suspect even that would add to the problems here.
