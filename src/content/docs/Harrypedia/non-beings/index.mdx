Various fans trying to make sense of the various bits of information provided by
Mrs. Rowling have come up with the concept of "Non-Human Spirituous Apparitions"
or "non-beings" to cover [boggarts][], [dementors][], [poltergeists][] and
possibly [banshees][].[^211020-8]  I agree the description and concepts they
have come up with fits well with what Mrs. Rowling has provided for us.  It is,
however, philosophically unacceptable to me at a really fundamental level.

[boggarts]: <boggart>

[dementors]: <dementor>

[poltergeists]: <poltergeist>

[banshees]: <banshee>

The basic premise is that sufficient concentrations of magic mixed with the
right negative emotion will produce a spirit that is functionally indestructible
and unkillable because, so the theory goes, being "alive" requires having a
physical body.  Since these things have never been "alive" they cannot be
killed, only driven away.

[balance of power]: <../balance>

There are two basic problems.  The first is that they disrupt the overall
[balance of power][] in the world Mrs. Rowling has created.  The other problem
is *that they are created*.  If they are created but never go away, then for
any sufficiently long time, they will overwhelm us by simple population
density.  There will be too many of them to drive away no matter even if every
one spent all day every day casting the spells to do so.  Sure, this is
theoretical calculus at its theoretical best.  For sufficiently slow or
sufficiently sporadic rates of creation, it might take sufficiently long to
reach this theoretical density that the Earth will be destroyed when the Sun
becomes a red giant.[^211020-9]  The point is that it is unacceptable that
something that *increases* in numbers cannot and does not also *decrease*
in numbers.
