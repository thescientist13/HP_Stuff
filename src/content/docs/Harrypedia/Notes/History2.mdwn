* 943 - Malcolm I of Scotland.[^20210406-31]

* 954 - Indulf of Scotland.[^20210406-32]

* 962 - Dub of Scotland.[^20210406-33]

* 967 - Cuilén An Fionn of Scotland.[^20210406-34]

* 971 - Kenneth II of Scotland, is reign appears to overlap with that of
  Amlaíb?[^20210406-36]

* 973 - Amlaíb of Scotland.[^20210406-35]

* 995 - Constantine III of Scotland.[^20210406-37]

* 1042 - Edward the Confessor of England (there are actually several Danish
  kings between Canute and Edward, but I need not list every single one).[^20210406-20]

* 1066 Norman invasion.[^20200704-3]  Malfoy family established in
  England[^20200810-1]

* 1066 - December 25, William I of England is the first Norman king(there were
  several kings after Edward and before William that do not matter).[^20210406-21]

* 1094 - Duncan II of Scotland, he is the first that is listed as "Rex
  Scottorum."[^20210406-38]

* 12th century (1100s) "Linfred of Stinchcombe, a locally well-beloved and
  eccentric man, whose nickname, ‘the Potterer’, became corrupted in time to
  ‘Potter’."[^20200810-2]  His eldest son marries the oldest granddaughter of
  Ignotus Peverell.[^20200810-6]

* 1189 - Richard I the Lionheart of England.[^20210406-22]

* 1215 Magna Carta first signed.[^20200713-1]  Per the article on it, it is
  clear that Catholicism is either universal, or nearly so, by this point. If we
  are to use the barons' rebellions as the origins of the
  Wizengamot[^20200713-2], then wizarding culture has been fairly heavily
  influenced by Christianity by this point.  How influenced?  In other words,
  how much of the wizards' conversion is real and how much is for show?
  Reference the "Fat Friar"'s presence as a Hogwart's ghost. Even if they are
  not practising Catholics, how much of the pagan culture have they actually
  lost? This is not a purely academic question; its answer will determine how
  much of the magic that multi-generational wizarding families practice is just
  wands, potions, and engraved runes and how much is ritual song, dance, chants,
  sacrifices, meals, and other elements of paganism.  It will also determine
  how, for lack of a better word, Victorian wizarding society can possibly
  become. 

* 1216 - Henry III of England, his rule was briefly disputed by the French
  king.[^20210406-24]

  a treaty acknowledging that "he had never been the legitimate king of
  England."[^20210406-23]

* 1258 - Parliament, initially a council of 15 barons, assembled under Henry III
  due to the "Provisions of Oxford" and the "Provisions of Westminster," unsure
  which (or both).[^20210406-3]

* 1272 - Edward I (Longshanks) of England.[^20210406-25] I am unsure why he is
  Edward the first when there are earlier Edwards.

* 1284 - England conquers Wales.[^20210406-2]

* 1286 - The Guardians of Scotland are regents who governed
  Scotland.[^20210406-39]  There seems to be more than one at any given time. 

* 1289 International Warlock Convention [^20200622-2]

* 1296 - Second period under the Guardians of Scotland.[^20210406-40]

  time.[^20210406-46]

  the rest of England.[^20210406-6]

* 1544 at the latest Wizengamot active.[^20200623-7]

* 1567 - James VI of Scotland.[^20210406-43]

* 1649 - Mnemone Radford, developer of Memory Modification Charms,
  dies.[^20210521-4]

* 1603 - James VI of Scotland becomes James I of England and
  Ireland.[^20210406-7]

* 1612-1652 Ralston Potter seated in the Wizengamot.  Statute of Secrecy being debated.[^20210122-24] 

* 1618-1648 Witch hunting across Europe reaches its apex during the 30 years war.[^20200704-4]

* 1644-1647 Witch hunting in England peaks during the English Civil
  War.[^20200704-5]

  Great Britain and the United Kingdom, have functioned in effect as a
  constitutional monarchy."[^20210406-8]

* 1689 - the International Statute of Secrecy in 1689.[^20200623-6]  In _[The
  Accidental Animagus](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/89/The-Accidental-Animagus)_ fanfiction author White Squirrel speculates that not only did society take an abrupt shift, with the pure-blood mania becoming more prominent than it had ever been, but that the magical society probably started to rewrite its own history, erasing evidence of its dealings with non-magical society, and of its own mutations and shifts over time.  In England, the Potters argue for the Statute to protect the Muggles,[^20200810-3] the Malfoys argue against it (to continue exploiting the wealthy among whom Malfoys often marry).[^20200810-4]  Once it passes, the Malfoys pretend to have been in favour all along.[^20200810-5]

* 1692 What would eventually be Coutts Bank is started by John Campbell at the
  sign of The Three Crowns in Strand, London.[^20200818-1]  At least one
  fanfiction uses this as a partly goblin owned bank to get around the Statute
  of Secrecy.[^20200818-2]

* 1707 - The Acts of Union 1707 establish Great Britain.[^20210406-9]

  Wizarding world was already in hiding.[^20210406-45]
