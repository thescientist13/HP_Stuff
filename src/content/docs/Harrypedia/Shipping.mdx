### Overview

I think that nearly all writers fall into one of a very few categories when dealing
with Harry.

* There are the "Lets see what sort of twisted torture we can put him through"
  group out there.  They come up with bizarre situations and pairings mostly just
  because they want to see the characters suffer.  
* There are a ton of people who really wanted Harry to end up with [Hermione].
  Some of these are simply lazy; [Hermione] is the only female with true
  character development in the series.  Some of these identify with
  [her][Hermione], and so the pairing is essentially wish fulfilment.
* There are people who write [Harry]/[Draco] or similar stories.  Some of these
  are reacting to Mrs. Rowling's unpopular opinions.  Some of these are doing
  the wish fulfilment thing - they have these types of attraction, and so need
  Harry to have them also.  Some of them are doing the "lets torture the
  characters" thing, and really belong in the first category.
* The writers that pair [Harry] with [Fleur], or [Nymphadora] are essentially
  the same as the ones that write harem stories.  The stories vary in
  sophistication from pure smut to something that can be surprisingly worth
  reading, but ultimately there is that underlying immaturity.  In all these
  cases, they are setting [Harry] up for a situation that is fundamentally
  unrealistic because they are not really dealing with real girls. Perhaps the
  author is doing that *because* these are fictional characters, and so this is
  a safe outlet for something the author knows full well is *not real.*  Perhaps
  it is because the author is *actually immature.*  Sometimes as a reader you
  can tell, other times only the author could truly say which.

Personally, while I am not totally immune to knowing this is a fantasy setting
with fictional characters that I can do things to, I do try to be *somewhat*
reasonable with my treatment of them.  I am not going to twist an established
character's personality just to introduce a political statement into a story.
Any "alternative universe" story allows for changing the characters to fit the
new universe, but I believe they should still be recognisably themselves.
