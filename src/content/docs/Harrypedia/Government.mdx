#### Ministry of Magic

* The Minister for Magic is democratically elected.[^210330-6]
* Like the British Parliament, there is no fixed term.[^210330-7]
* Elections at least once every seven years.[^210330-8]

[^210330-6]: Mrs. J. K. Rowling.

#### Wizengamot

* We know there are about 50 members at [Harry][]'s trial,[^210329-4] when it sits
  in a "full criminal trial"[^210329-6] or in other words, "the full
  court."[^210329-7]
* We do not know if "the full court" is the same as "the full Wizengamot," it is
  possible that some subset is on a "Judicial Committee" or
  some-such.[^210329-8]
* We know that, at least when sitting as a court, [Mr. Weasley][Arthur]
  is not allowed in.[^210329-9]
* We know that, at least when sitting as a court, Mr. Malfoy is not allowed
  in.[^210329-10]
* It is strongly implied that the Malfoy family does in fact have a title from
  the Norman conquest.[^210330-2]
* We are told that a Potter "has twice sat on the Wizengamot"[^210330-1]
* Both of these have been at key times in Wizard/Non-Wizard
  relations.[^210517-14] This suggests that members may not be
  elected.[^210517-15]
* There exists a "British Youth Representative to the Wizengamot"[^210329-11]
* We know that the Wizengamot has a Charter of Rights.[^210329-5] This
  suggests, but does not prove, a legislative function.
* Able to at least suggest that a Minister leave office.[^210330-9]

Any number of stories, including _[Not Normal][RNN1]_, which I have referenced
as an example of interesting world building time and time again, fall into the
trap of assuming that the Wizengamot is populated by those who either do or did
hold titles of nobility.  _[Not Normal][RNN2]_ attempts to reconcile how this
might work, but it ultimately fails the consistency check.  Disregarding Mrs.
Rowling's date for the [Malfoy][] family's introduction to England is
relatively minor, but you also have to rewrite the [Potter][] and [Black][]
histories.  You are essentially ignoring *all* genealogical information not
just from secondary canonical sources like [Pottermore][], you are even
ignoring some from the books.  If the Wizengamot is based on noble titles, then
[Harry][]'s status as [Sirius][]' godson is insufficient to explain
inheritance, [Harry][] must also be biologically related to the
[Blacks][Black].  The problem is that there is no Euphemia Black in the
[Black][] tree, and no reasonable [Black][] who might have married [Henry
Potter][Henry].

_["Great Scott, Potter, This is War!"][GSP1]_ on the other hand assumes that
membership is based on being an influential family back when our theoretical
treaty of separation was negotiated.[^211007-1]  To make this story work, the
author posited that while we may have *records* of the Potter family only as far
back of as [Linfred the Potterer][Linfred], the family itself is much
older.[^211007-2]  The primary problems with this are that it contradicts the
origin story for the [Potter][]s and possibly others, and that it gives the
[Malfoy][] a seat in the "Full Wizengamot" that, per the above, they do not
seem to have.  A secondary problem with this is that it seems to ignore the
[Peverell][] family name, with the accompanying backstory for the Deathly
Hallows.  Lastly, it does not solve the problem of voting inheritance between
the [Black][] and [Potter][] families (though this might be considered part of
my statement that it contradicts the origin stories).
