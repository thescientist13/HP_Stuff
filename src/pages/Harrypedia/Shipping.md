### Overview

I think that nearly all writers fall into one of a very few categories when
dealing with [Harry] and [Hermione].

* There are the "Lets see what sort of twisted torture we can put him/her
  through" group out there.  They come up with bizarre situations and
  pairings mostly just because they want to see the characters suffer.
* There are a ton of people who really wanted Harry to end up with [Hermione].
  Some of these are simply lazy; [Hermione] is the only female with true
  character development in the series.  Some of these identify with
  [her][Hermione], and so the pairing is essentially wish fulfilment.
* There are people who write [Harry]/[Draco] or similar stories.  Some
  of these are reacting to Mrs. Rowling's unpopular opinions.  Some
  of these are doing the wish fulfilment thing - they have these types
  of attraction, and so need Harry to have them also.  Some of them are
  doing the "lets torture the characters" thing, and really belong in
  the first category.  [Jeconais] is known for his fluffy stories in which [Harry] enters a relationship with a girl and in doing so finds the confidence to become Super Harry.  In one of his stories, he includes the following that summarizes the improbability of this type of story:
  > If he didn’t have Ginny, if by some quirk of nature, he didn’t like girls, if he lived in a world where water flowed uphill and he was actually gay, there was still no way at all that he could ever be anything other than polite to the ferret.[^240415-1]
* A number of authors will pair [Sirius] with [Remus].  For most of these,
  I believe it is a way to make a statement of disagreement with Mrs. Rowling'S
  unpopular opinions without drastically changing central characters. The exception is where it becomes a focus of the story and we start to see lots of scenes *about their relationship.*  Then I think it is a case of the author
  exploring his own situation but trying not to stomp all over [Harry] as a recognisable character. 
* The writers that pair [Harry] with [Fleur], or [Nymphadora] are
  essentially the same as the ones that write harem stories.  I tend to avoid these.  While a 3 year age gap is neglible in your late 20s, it is a wide chasm between teens.  [Harry] may have needed to grow up fast in some ways,
  but he is not ever really going to be ready for a relationship with a much older woman while still a young student. 
* Harem stories vary in sophistication from pure smut to something that
  can be surprisingly worth reading, but nearly every case there is that
  underlying immaturity.  Even where both smut and immaturity are avoided, they are setting [Harry] up for a situation that is fundamentally unrealistic because they are not really dealing with real girls. Perhaps the author is doing that *because* these are fictional characters, and so this is a safe
  outlet for something the author knows full well is *not real.*  Perhaps
  it is because the author is *actually immature.*  Sometimes as a
  reader you can tell, other times only the author could truly say which.

This is not only fiction, but fan fiction.  It is *really really* hard
to resist the temptation to explore the holes in Mrs. Rowling's world
building.  As part of that, it is *really really* hard not to put the
characters in totally unrealistic and impossible interpersonal
situations, because these situations allow me to explore some of the
interesting holes.  Things like [contracts], [veela], [life debts], and
even to some extent the [trace] are hard to fully play with unless you
deal with adult situations.


On a related note, there are a couple of common representations of [Lily].
* She is a money/power hungry person who married [James] *because* he was a rich
  pure-blood.  She either used love potions on [James] or took advantage of him.
  * In these stories, you will occasionally find that she cheated on [James]
    and that [Snape] is really [Harry]'s father.  Magic was used to disguise this.
* She was drugged by [James], who unscrupulously used love potions.  She would 
  have left him as soon as she as uninfluenced. 
* She was super intelligent and [James] was an utter moron.
  * If the first assumption is also true, she tolerates this because she needs
    the family name/wealth.
  * If it isn't, then she might not have realised it until she sees him 
    squandering that wealth in blind obedience to [Dumbledore].
  * He might recognise this and put her in charge. 

More rarely, you see one or more of these subverted, for example *she* blindly follows [Dumbledore] while [James] is more suspicious.  It is exceptionally rare to find a positive representation of both [Lily] and [James].  I find none of these biases acceptable in a story, and will strongly consider abandoning that story as soon as I come across them.

When I write fan fiction, I want to walk a line.  I want to expose the problems she has created, and explore some of the implications.  On the other hand, I do try to be *somewhat* reasonable with my treatment of the characters.
While there are enjoyable aspects of _[For Want of an Outfit]_, it has an
acceptance of kinkiness that, I think, distorts the characters too much.  I do not want my story to focus on the smut, because I am not writing the unrealistic relationships in to titillate, but to push the bounds of the defined universe.  To expose how the magic causes problems, and to force the very flawed characters to deal with them.  

I do cause things to happen that are only remotely possible because Mrs. Rowling has introduced, bluntly, magic, without fully
defining or confining it.  I am certainly not going to twist an
established character's personality just to introduce a political
statement into a story.  Any "alternative universe" story allows for
changing the characters to fit the new universe, but I believe they
should still be recognisably themselves.  There can, however, be a butterfly effect thing, where a character's personality grows a different way because of
things that go differently from the books.
