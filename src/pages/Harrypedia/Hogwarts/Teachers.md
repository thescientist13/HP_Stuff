In more general terms, what is the role of the head of each house?
[McGonagall] shows up to intervene in Gryffindor's internal discipline only
in [Harry]'s third year.[^20200811-1] [Harry] finds [Luna] wandering the
halls barefoot, posting flyers listing her stolen stuff, and [Flitwick]
does nothing.[^20200811-2] I have a page dedicated to [McGonagall], and it
would be hard to write too much here that would not also go there, so these
two examples will have to suffice for now. It seems that the school
expects the prefects to run the school. I am unsure how typical of British
boarding schools this is, Stalky of _[Stalky & Co.][]_ by Rudyard Kipling
goes on an extended rant about the evils of married teachers, and how it
puts too much responsibility on the prefects.[^20210521-6] _Stalky & Co._
is certainly idealised, no doubt in a lot of ways, but if you read
carefully you can tell there is a lot of bullying, it is a rough life, but
it is kept sufficiently in check that most of them come out of it …
typically British (see the quote on bullying in the Students section). If
_Stalky_ thinks that it would be _worse_ if the teachers he describes do
_less_, well, then we have to assume that the few phrases we have hinting
at the problems within Hogwarts are actually understating things.

Look at the roles that play out in _Stalky_ versus _Harry Potter_. In
_Stalky_ we see prefects giving out discipline, including corporal
punishment, but each house has a head that advocates for its students,
steps in for discipline problems within the house beyond the scope or
abilities of the prefects, and is generally present and visible not just as
a teacher, but _as a head of house_. Indeed, in _Stalky_, the prefects are
rarely mentioned, several of the school masters who head Houses are the
most frequent disciplinarians (this might be because Stalky has the
prefects totally intimidated). The Head is called in for exceptional
problems, and if I recall, the punishment is made especially severe to
discourage "bothering the Head." Does any of this sound like Hogwarts? At
Hogwarts every problem most likely not at all, otherwise by the prefects,
and finally, by [Dumbledore] with [Snape] attending as advisor, no matter
who is involved. Never mind [McGonagall] is Deputy Head, and therefore
more logically the advisor at that point, we need a more Charles Dickens
feel about it. Which is probably precisely the point.
