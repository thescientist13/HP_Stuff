### General Information

Keeping track of exactly how old a student is by age is not natural to me. For
whatever reason I tend to think of school age children in terms of their class,
except being from the United States, I use that education system, not the
British ones. I put together [a table][comparitive_class_ages] to help with
that.

### Who are they

Cannon focuses on [Harry][]'s classmates almost exclusively. [Harry's
Yearmates][] is probably the best source for almost cannon
information,[^200419-1] though _Secrets of the Classlist_[^200630-1] also
contains a ton. The two disagree on a few things. Some of this has been
corrected by Mrs. Rowling,[^200630-3] most of it has not. In general, the
latter is better researched, the former easier to find information in.
Information on the class lists for pretty much any other year is entirely
absent. One would think that in an age where people obsessively wiki things
(myself not really excluded), someone would have compiled the available data,
but if so I have not found it. Thus, I have started [this list][ClassLists],
some of these people are also in the [Gramps][] data I have
[extracted][people].

### "Racial" Breakdown

One of the problems with the above sources is that I've ended up with 6 first
generation wizards, 11 halfboods and 18 purebloods in [Harry][]'s class. This
gives me a class that is 45% pureblooded, despite [Mr. Weasley][Arthur] being
quoted as saying that purebloods are dying out, and that most families are
halfblooded.[^200817-1] Some of that may be the influence of the first
Riddle war, where entire families were wiped out. I imagine the halfblooded
families were disproportionately affected by that. One author takes it a step
further, essentially counting the children of first generation witches and
wizards as still being themselves culturally first generation, and accounting
for nearly all the deaths.[^211001-1] Still, returning to facts, if there
should be about 1000 students at Hogwarts,[^200817-2] then we should have
35-36 per house per year, not 40 per year total. If we had 140 students in
[Harry][]'s year, then the 18 purebloods would be only 13% of the class, and the
muggleborn only 4%.

That assumes that all 116 students killed by Riddle are halfblooded (or at
least that the ones that were pureblooded would be in different years), which
is probably not totally true but more nearly true than not. However, there is
another interesting possibility. As best I can recall, _the Deathly Hallows_
never says what happens to the first generation wizards who should have been
part of that year's first year class. We know that some of the older ones went
into hiding, some of them successfully, some not.[^200819-2] On the other
hand, it seems like at least some of them attended Hogwarts anyway, based on
the people present in the Room of Requirement when Harry makes it
there.[^200819-3]

Another possibility is that the Death Eaters used contacts within the Ministry
of Magic's Accidental Magic Reversal Squad or the Improper Use of Magic office
to get word of under aged magic users, and to kill the muggle ones.[^200819-4]
If so, it is possible that they may have killed _fewer_ of them in the years
between the two Riddle wars, but not completely stopped. This would
artificially deflate the number of first generation wizards not just in
[Harry][]'s year, but in all of the classes we see in the books. While
[Mr. Weasley][Arthur]'s "Muggle Protection Act" argues against this idea, it
does seem believable of [Umbridge] and those like her who set up the laws under
Pius Thicknesse's puppet government.

[^200819-2]:
    I'm assuming that both [Dean Thomas][Dean] and the Death Eaters would
    have regarded [Dean] as a first generation wizard. We are told [Dean] did not
    know about his father, and if the Death Eaters did, they would have
    considered him a blood traitor anyway. Thus that makes at least one student
    who went into hiding unsuccessfully.

    It certainly does not mention nearly enough people coming
    through the portrait tunnel, and pretty much his entire class, plus both
    Creevy boys seem to be there. Get a citation for this.
