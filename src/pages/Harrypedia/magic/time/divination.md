Divination is essentially a a form of time magic in that it is allowing present knowledge about either

- future events states
- events or states too distant to be known
- events or states otherwise hidden from direct observation.

In this context, but "states" I mean "states of being" not "nation states." For example the "state of the economy" or "the value shown on the next role of dice."

Where divination is about discovering _current_ states or events that are otherwise unknowable, there are no problems. Often called "scrying" in other works, this form of magic might be done using a crystal ball, a mirror, a pool of water, or any number of things that authors have come up with over the centuries.

However, when divination becomes the quest for _future_ knowledge, we get into messy questions of free will versus predestination. Many fan fiction works in which characters read books or see movies about themselves explore this in a small way when [Harry] or another character confronts the fact that he (or she)
_will_ fall in love with [Ginny] (or whomever as appropriate), but _has not done so yet._ Should existing relationships be pursued? Are any feelings from that point on in fact genuine? Is it love if you cannot _not_ love the person, if there is no _choice_ to be with him or her involved?

[Dumbledore] appears to have mixed thoughts on this subject himself. On one hand he tells [Harry] that free will is real, that the prophecy need not be fulfilled,[^240417-1] that it is the choices that he ([Harry]) and [Riddle] make that matter. On the other hand, [Dumbledore] [does not act]. His own behaviour says that he is waiting for the prophecy to run its course, and feels constrained by its terms. For why else is he not more proactive during the aftermath of the first [Riddle] war, or in the years between the wars?

In her interviews, Mrs. Rowling says that she _intends_ that prophecy does not negate free will, that [Harry] and [Riddle] _could_ have ignored it, walked away, and both lived.[^240417-2] For my purposes, I will take this position, and [Dumbledore]'s speech to [Harry], as the correct interpretation. To the extent that divination _does_ involve time, it can only be true because it is a [self-fulfilling prophecy]. I care not what form of divination we are dealing with; if true magic is involved, you are seeing a _possible_ future that becomes _the_ future only because _someone made it so._
