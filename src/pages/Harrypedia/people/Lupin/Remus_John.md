* Lupin considers it so highly probable that his child will be a werewolf that
  "if, by some miracle, it is not like me, then it will be better off, a hundred
  times so, without a father"[^211007-5]
* The third movie generally shows him in a tweed coat.[^211108-2]  The *book*
  describes him in robes, not muggle clothing.[^211108-3]
* He seems to have worked as a teacher/tutor even before coming back to
  Hogwarts.[^211108-4]
* He uses tea bags, not loose tea.[^211108-5]

### Analysis 

The overall impression I get is that Remus is *familiar* with the non-magical
world, but that the movie over-emphasises the extent to which the magical
world's fashion has kept up with the times.  I talk more about that though in
the [Culture] section.

Of more concern here, I think the movie did much to cement the impression of
Lupin as not just a bookworm, but as the brains of his group of
friends.[^211108-8] As I note as I look at [James Potter][James], this view
*really* does not make sense.  Lupin is the one that feels the need to study,
whereas [James] and [Sirius] (**_not_** Lupin or [Lily]) are the ones that
[McGonagall] describes as the cleverest students in the school,[^211108-6] and
exceptionally bright.[^211108-7]  I do not doubt the man did well in school, but
he worked for it, whereas his more intelligent friends found the material easy.

In many ways, this quote adequately says all there is to say:

> We got a very good look at his character in Book 3, when he didn’t tell anyone
> that Sirius was an animagus. In other words, he concealed crucial information
> about someone he thought was trying to kill Harry, and his reasoning was that
> he didn’t want to admit to Dumbledore that he’d made some questionable
> decisions more than a decade earlier. Seriously? Dumbledore being disappointed
> is a bigger concern than your best friend’s son’s life? That’s messed up. And
> Lupin just goes downhill from there, until he eventually abandons his pregnant
> wife. In some ways, I think it’s a good thing that he died. At least he went
> out a hero. If he’d lived, he probably would have been a deadbeat dad that
> left Tonks and Teddy when it turned out that married life was a bit tougher
> than he expected.[^20210519-12]

The man is, despite his placement in [Gryffindor], a coward.  He has better
reasons for being one than most of us, his disease provides him better
justification than most of us ever have, but does not change the reality.
Because of a change that occurs a few nights a year, he holds himself aloof from
all relationships.[^211202-3]  Because he cannot face that disease, he
(temporarily) abandons his wife.  He shows his [Gryffindor] attributes in going
back to her when his face is sufficiently rubbed in the shame, yes.  He deserves
some credit for that,  I maintain however, that the above quote is indeed a fair
summation of the man.  I believe he would have, given time and stress, again
lapsed. He was his fundamental nature to let people down.

Worse, it was not just his wife he abandoned.  His rationale is both pathetic and absurd.  He states that because he is a warewolf, his child will probably be a warewolf, and will therefore be better off without his/her warewolf father.  It would, apparently, be better that the child face the disease without the help from someone who can empathise with the pain of both the disease and the resulting social ostracism. As a werewolf himself, he apparently has nothing of value to offer his child on coping with the affliction. As a being, he is allowing those nights to define the totality of his contribution to the child's life.  Like many before him, he has internalised the prejudice against himself, and become his own worst enemy.
