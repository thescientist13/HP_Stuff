### As a family

The Dursley family is a children's book caricature, and next to impossible to
make any sense of.  I am not a psychologist, so all of this might be incredibly
off base, but they simply do not make sense, and so, I think, have to simply be
taken as the fictional constructs they are.  

Petunia's description is of a nervous anorexic woman; Vernon's is of blustering,
short tempered, massively obese man.  Looked at from the outside, it would be
hard to envision a more mismatched pair, something I think was intentionally
done to give the books a sort of Roald Dahl-ish feel to them.  However, if you
try to make something less children's literature and more something that
actually makes sense, you would swear that Petunia was an abused housewife. That
does not, however, seem to be the case.  She is a shrew, and, if anything,
Vernon is very slightly wary of her.  In first meeting them, we find that he is
cautious of reminding her of her sister.[^210422-1] In the fifth book, look at
how quickly he backs down when Petunia says that Harry will in fact remain in
the house after the dementor attack.[^210422-2] Neither fits the profile I
would expect if he dominated her. 

Sure there are counter examples to this, where he over rides her, but the
relationship is either surprisingly balanced, or even more surprisingly tilted in
her direction.

### How abusive were they?

* [Harry][] is "small and skinny for his age".[^221005-1]  
* [Harry][]'s cupboard is full of spiders
* [Harry][]'s cupboard is "dark."[^190610-4]
* "Dudley's favourite punching bag was Harry"[^190610-2]
* Vernon is not just violent towards [Harry][]: 

  > Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had
  > hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack
  > his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag.[^200513-1]
* What does it mean to be "given a week in the cupboard" given he sleeps there
  nightly anyway?[^190610-5] Certainly that the door is locked from the
  outside[^190610-6] at least some of the time, but not all of
  it.[^190610-8]
* Vernon is not the only one offering potentially severe physical harm to Harry: 

  > Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither Dudley nor the hedge was
  > in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn't really done magic, but he still
  > had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan.
  > Then she gave him work to do, with the promise he wouldn't eat again until
  > he'd finished.[^200513-2]
* Incarceration like this is illegal now, and probably frowned upon even then: 

  > Uncle Vernon was as bad as his word. The following morning, he paid a man to
  > fit bars on Harry’s window. He himself fitted a cat-flap in the bedroom
  > door, so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a
  > day. They let Harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening. Otherwise,
  > he was locked in his room around the clock.[^200513-3]
* Vernon strangles Harry in _the Order of the Phoenix_[^200513-4]
* [Harry][] has some disturbing habits: 

  > “You'd need more than a good sense of fun to liaise with my uncle,” said
  >  Harry darkly. “Good sense of when to duck, more like.”[^200513-5]

  and then the quote: 

  > Harry ran down the stairs two at a time, coming to an abrupt halt several
  > steps from the bottom, as long experience had taught him to remain out of
  > arm’s reach of his uncle whenever possible.[^200513-6]
* On the other hand "I accept there’s something strange about you, probably nothing
  a good beating wouldn’t have cured"[^190610-7] suggests that [Harry][]'s abuse has been
  emotional in nature (along with neglect of course) and not physical.
* [Dumbledore][]'s most quoted words on the subject come from
  the meeting in his ([Dumbledore][]'s) office just after
  [Sirius][] dies.

  > Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had
  > planned and intended. Well - not quite whole. You had suffered. I knew you
  > would when I left you on your aunt and uncle's doorstep. I knew I was
  > condemning you to ten dark and difficult years.[^210128-1]

  This statement is ambiguous in a number of different senses.  Just what did
  [Dumbledore][] know, considering the Dursleys had not acted
  yet, what does [Dumbledore][] mean by "not quite whole," "suffered," and
  "dark and difficult"?  Each of these can be taken a number of different ways.
  His next statement on the subject, in book six, sheds somewhat more
  meaningful light:

  > You have never treated Harry as a son. He has known nothing but neglect and
  > often cruelty at your hands. The best that can be said is that he has at
  > least escaped the appalling damage you have inflicted upon the unfortunate
  > boy sitting between you.[^210128-2]

There are also some descriptions of Vernon's behaviour, particularly in the
third chapter of _the Philosopher's Stone_, that may or may not be Vernon
talking more aggressively than he acts, and may or may not be figurative
language rather than a literal description of how he treats [Harry][].  Overall
there is certainly verbal abuse and neglect.  By today's standards we'd consider
the above list sufficient to tack on physical abuse as well though.  Harry
should not have needed to learn to _habitually_ stay out of reach for example.
From my reading of other people's comments on this topic,[^211025-1] I have
gathered that the standards for what constituted child abuse were more lax in
the 1980s (when Harry was growing up), and even more so in Britain as compared
to the United States, but I have no authoritative evidence of that, just
hearsay.

In short, as another (better) author puts it, 

> I think the Dursleys were much more physically abusive towards their nephew -
> if you can grab him around the throat or swing a frying pan at his head, not
> to mention starving him and locking him in a cupboard, I think there is a lot
> more going on.[^210604-1]

While Mrs. Rowling may have chosen not to show us everything, she has shown
enough that a reasonable adult should be able to see the forest as well as the
trees.

There is another perspective to consider, this comes from fanfiction, but there
is a ring of truth to it:

> “Your mother’s sacrifice did far more than protect you from Voldemort’s curse
> that night,” Dumbledore explained. “It protected you from your own relatives
> in their home—your aunt and cousin, who share your mother’s blood, and your
> uncle, who is also bound to the charm by his marriage to your aunt. With Lily
> Potter’s protection upon you, they could not harm you.” He held up a hand.
> “Yes, I know they treated you badly—worse than even I suspected. But nothing
> they did could truly have damaged you. They tried to hit you, and they missed,
> you dodged, they lost their nerve, or they simply didn’t hit that hard, like
> your cousin. They tried to starve you, and they “gave up on it,” as you said,
> before you were at serious risk. You see, Harry, they could not have killed
> you, even if they had tried. Nor could they have done you any lasting injury,
> either physical or psychological.”
> 
> Harry sat frozen, his mind racing, trying to reevaluate everything he knew
> about his life according to these revelations. Psychological? What, now?
> 
> Dumbledore noted the look of confusion on his face and continued: “They
> neglected you, insulted you, threatened you, punished you for accidental
> magic, and treated you like their personal house elf. And yet, you shook it
> all off with ease. You picked up at Hogwarts right where you left off,
> well-adjusted, making friends, and enjoying yourself. What you went through,
> Harry, is something no child should have to endure, but you have not only
> endured, but thrived in spite of it, because your mother’s sacrifice placed on
> you the protection of her love—a protection both physical and emotional. Her
> love has always been with you. It flows in your very veins. No matter how much
> those in your physical presence tried to make you feel unloved—relatives or
> not—no matter how much the outside world turned against you, she was always
> with you, supporting you, even if you were not consciously aware of
> it.[^200610-1]
