Despite being nearly universally portrayed as a pure-blood in fan fiction, she is in fact a half-blood who grew up in the mundane world.  She should be familiar with early 19th century fashion, customs and technology. 

### Analysis

I really want to like Professor McGonagall, but so much that happens at
[Hogwarts] is troubling that I am conflicted about her. She is, in some ways,
the quintessential Harry Potter Series [adult].  _The Board_[^190823-1] by
[Clell65619][dmffan] shows a critical view of her that I am, despite myself,
really drawn to.  This view is more or less seconded by _[When Is It a
Contract][WIIAC]_ which focuses on the conflicts between her roles as Deputy and
Head of House.[^210322-2]

[adult]: <../../adults>

Better detectives than I have pieced together her probable timeline, assuming
you ignore the Fantastic Beasts movies.  Born in 1935, she started [Hogwarts]
in 1947.[^211103-1]  She joined [Hogwarts] at a time when there was more than one teacher in the Transfiguration Department, approximately 2 or 3 years after her graduation.[^200720-7]  She informs [Umbridge] that she will have been at Hogwarts "Thirty-nine years this December,"[^200720-8] sometime in the beginning of fifth year, or 1995. That puts her start date in 1956.  Despite this, we are told that she intervened when [Leta Lestrange][LL2] was bullied at age 13 in 1910,[^211018-1] and when [Theseus][TS1] was a student.[^211018-2]  This would require her to have either left [Hogwarts] for a time, or to have been a teacher for at least 85 years.[^211018-3]

[LL2]: ../../lestrange/leta/

[Umbridge]: ../../umbridge/delores_jane/

[TS1]: ../../scamander/theseus/

The first problematic moment is easy to miss.  Per the timeline above, she was
already teaching at [Hogwarts] in 1981, and yet, on November 1st 1981, she is
able to spend the day on Privet Drive apparently waiting for [Dumbledore][AD1]
to arrive any time all day, having heard from [Hagrid] that he would at some
point be there.[^220927-5]  As head of house, did she not have an obligation to
be available to her students in this time of excitement?  As Deputy Head,
should she not have stayed at the school to handle any emergencies there when
the Headmaster was absent?  Keep in mind, we are told that she is doing this of
on her own initiative, as she was "not inducted into the Order of the Phoenix
during Voldemort's first climb to power."[^220927-6]

The next is more obvious, the detention in the night she catches [Harry]
and [Hermione] out after they deliver Norbert.[^210429-1] Earlier that
night she had caught [Malfoy][Draco], and believed him to be telling lies about
[Harry] and a dragon.  This resulted in a detention and a loss of twenty
points.[^210429-2] On catching [Harry], [Hermione] and [Neville], she
asks for an explanation, and when one is not forthcoming, infers one from the
facts available to her.  It is at this point that I believe that she sees in
front of her [James Potter][James] and not [Harry Potter]. 

She infers that [Harry] and [Hermione] have maliciously tricked
[Malfoy][Draco] into thinking they would be out after curfew to get him in
trouble.  Per that logic, [Neville] overheard the story, and was accidentally
tricked as well.  Let us play this out.

At the time she caught [Malfoy][Draco], was this already in her mind? If not, she deducted thirty points less per student for [Malfoy][Draco]'s (seemingly) identical actions.  At the time she punished [Malfoy][Draco], she supposedly thought him lying to her, out after hours for no good reason, during these "especially" dangerous times.  When she found out about the other three, Draco is now found to have been, from his perspective, telling the truth.  She neither reduces his (Draco's) punishment, nor gives [Harry] and [Hermione] the same punishment as [Malfoy][Draco].  Next, she gives [Neville] an identical punishment to [Harry] and [Hermione], despite the fact that he is, per her theory, not involved in the plot on [Malfoy][Draco], after all [Harry] and [Hermione] supposedly think it funny that [Neville] was caught also.  

The punishment is entirely intended to be over the top.  It is *intended* to
cause the rest of the house to shun them.  That is why she does not step in as
people from three houses do not "trouble to lower their voices as they insulted
him."[^210504-2]  McGonagall is *not* seeing [Harry], small for his age (he
has to be, see my page specifically on [Harry]), shy, and uncertain.  No; she
is seeing [James], bold, brash, almost cruel in his pranks.  She is
purposefully going overboard to head off that type of behaviour.  Better that
[Harry] suffer rejection by his peers than mirror his father's early years in
school.  

[James]: <../../potter/james>

The exact situation in Worldmaker's _[Furious Angels][WMFA1]_ is different, but
the description of McGonagall is spot on:

> The entire situation was just troubling, and she didn't like troubling.  She
> liked orderly. She liked quiet and peaceful and predictable.  To the
> Transfiguration professor, chaos was to be avoided, and when it couldn't be
> avoided, it was to be put down quickly, efficiently, and with as much of a
> lesson to the chaos-maker as possible.[^210922-2]

While the rest of her backstory is bogus in _[The Bonds of Blood][TBoB]_, that
echos the characterisation of her as "a warrior of order" who "despised
chaos."[^220729-2]

The part that makes this questionable is twofold.  One, she knows full well that
[James] grew up spoiled and loved where [Harry] grew up in a family she
herself had observed and had doubts about.  She should have known by that point
that [Harry] behaved nothing like [James].  Secondly, [Neville] did not
need to be crushed.  If [Harry] was cruelly amused that [Neville] was caught up
in the prank, there is no need to give [Harry] and [Neville] identical
treatment.  Is it her intention to warn [Neville] away from associating with a
troublesome Potter?

Then she sends the four of them into the Forbidden Forest, at eleven at night,
to search for the same unicorn that is being hunted by something that is both
dark (evil) and potentially dangerous.  Do not get me wrong, I like [Hagrid].
I would even trust him to an extent, but I qualify that because as we see over
and over again across the series, [Hagrid] does not have a realistic risk
evaluation for people without his half-giant heritage.  McGonagall should know
this, and should be able and willing to compensate for it.  

[Hagrid]: <../../hagrid/rubeus>

The only possible saving explanations for the detention are either that
McGonagall had no choice, that [Dumbledore][AD1] in fact set it up and she was
the messenger, or that she was in some way unaware of [Hagrid]'s plans.  If the
former, I am disappointed that she continues to work for a man who would put
students in his care in that situation.  If the latter, I'm disappointed that
she is that naive. 

The next is less clear cut.  I have trouble believing that everyone wearing the
"Support Cedric" badges was so sneaky that McGonagall never saw the "Potter
Stinks" version of them.  The badges should have been confiscated, and it really
would have only taken any responsible teacher (that is to day, not [Snape])
seeing the change once to know that they all did it and they all needed to go.
Again, it is possible that [Dumbledore][AD1] tied her hands.  If so, it says
something less than positive about her that she allowed him to do so.

I have mixed feelings about her initial treatment when she is notified that
[Harry] has a week of detentions with [Umbridge].  It seems to me that either
as Deputy Headmistress or as Head of House, that her role is *precisely* to get
involved in discipline issues.  That is why [Harry] was sent to her at all in
fact.  Still, [Harry] *does* need to learn to keep his temper.  I would tend
to argue though that there is a difference between learning to pick your battles
(which [Harry] needs to do) and learning to "keep your head down"[^210429-3]
which is what she advises him to do.  Picking your battles and keeping your
temper are life skills that [Harry] lacks and needs.  Keeping your head down is
an act of fear.  I sympathise with [Harry] resenting that advice.  Professor
McGonagall has worked with teens for many years now.  She should know that her
Gryffindors will interpret her "keep your head down" as cowardice, and that she
needs be more careful with her wording to successfully reach them. 

As [Harry]'s fifth year progresses, I wonder that the teachers did not resign
in protest.  At some point being complicit is a problem.  Sure you can argue
about wanting to protect your students to the extent possible.  There is some
merit to that argument.  This was not (yet) however the situation with
[Headmaster Snape][Snape].  Could the Ministry really have kept things under
control if [Sprout], McGonagall and [Flitwick] had refused to cooperate more
overtly?  Had they resigned, sure [Fudge] could have appointed more of his
stooges.  He could not have prevented the fact of their resignation from
getting out however.  If they had more backbone, I have to believe they have
the connections to have made their opinions known. 

[Sprout]: <../../sprout/pomona>

[Flitwick]: <../../flitwick/filus>

[Fudge]: <../../fudge/cornelius_oswald>

With this history of either following [Dumbledore][AD1]'s lead as blindly and
mindlessly as a sheep, or of complicit negligence in the many situations
[Harry] found himself in, what kind of headmistress would McGonagall have
made?  Where _[The Board][CTB2]_ assumes that she would not get the post,
old-crow's version of _[Unintended Consequences][OCUC1]_ assumes she *does* get
appointed, but cannot really handle the position.  It portrays her as someone
totally devoted to enforcing [Dumbledore][AD1]'s vision for the school, even in
the face of a situation where it is clearly apparent that vision must change.
In this portrayal, she is indecisive, unable to let go of the authority she has
been given (because someone else would implement the changes she dislikes) but
also unable to fully embrace her new role (because she is a natural follower
and teacher, not an administrator or leader).  

I think this is a little bit overly harsh.  I agree that McGonagall is not much
of a leader, she is a natural follower.  As such, she would make a poor head of
school.  However, I think she would do more to attempt to fulfil her new role.
She would not leave vital teaching posts empty the way old-crow's version of her
character does.  That being said, I think old-crow is spot on in portraying her
as someone who would resist change simply because it is change, and would resist
incorporating non-magical classes no matter how needed or useful they might be.
