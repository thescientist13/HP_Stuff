### Analysis

One of Mrs. Rowling great themes across the Harry Potter series is the
redeeming power of love.  She is absolutely right to consider love one of the
most powerful forces in existence, and one of the most magical.  As she is
writing for children, I cannot fault her wanting to make the world more nearly
black and white, with good guys and bad guys.  In such a world, Severus, being
one of the good guys, must be redeemed.  [Harry][], being even more clearly one
of the good guys, must not only be part of his redemption, but must recognise
and champion it.  This gives us the epilogue, with a child of [Harry][]'s named
Albus Severus, the two characters that Mrs. Rowling most wants the reader to
forgive.

[Harry]: <../../potter/harry_james>

The books are, however, not *really* children's books at all.  I disagree with
classifying the latter books as such, and am restricting my own children's
reading of them, keeping them at one book a year starting from when they turn
eight. The first few books are fine; while there are some troubling things in
them, it will largely go over a child's head with little risk of influence
or damage.  However, as one advances through the books, there is more that
requires mature judgement, because more and more, the characters are making
decisions, and in the case of the adults, revealing past decisions, that
require the reader to recognise that good people can make bad choices, and,
yes, bad people can make good choices.

Severus Snape is a very grey character.  He, like most children, starts
out fallen, but essentially unformed.  He comes from an abusive back-
ground,[^200806-1] and apparently has very little of [Harry][]'s extraordinary
resilience.  As such, he is damaged.  He is given no help to recover from this
damage. We have no true picture of what [Hogwarts][] looked like while the
Marauders, [Lily][] and Severus were there, but that much we can be fairly
certain of.  We know that some of the Slytherins students are either openly
Death Eaters, or are openly vying to become Death Eaters.[^200806-2]  We know
that at least one female student was assaulted in an unknown way by [dark
magic][], that Severus calls it funny, and [Lily][] calls it evidence of
Mulciber being "creepy."[^200806-3]  When it comes to Severus, [Sirius][] is
hardly unbiased, but I think we *can* trust him when he says that Severus's
interest in the [Dark Arts][] was well known.[^210601-1]  I could go on,
but you can see that, already, [McGonagall][] and [Dumbledore][] are allowing
not just pranks, but actual evil to go unpunished.  In such an environment, the
needs of victims are not going to be addressed.

As I said, we know little of Severus at school, but his memories from _the
Deathly Hallows_ have a few things that are possibly suggestive.  In one scene
[Lily][] reacts strongly when Severus uses the phrase "I won't let you" in
reference to her understanding of, or possibly her relationship (or lack there
of) with [James][].[^210106-1]  A scene later we have the incident where he
calls her a mudblood and she ends their friendship.  Next we see her refusal to
forgive him, apparently because she does not believe his protestations.  Unlike
[Dumbledore][], [Lily][] wants repentance to be accompanied by evidence of
reform.  Alternately, some writers have speculated that [Lily][] was seeing
parallels between Severus' behaviour and his father's.[^210106-2]  The whole
fifth year thing is really complicated, and ultimately worth a [deeper
look][swm].  Either way, if you accept statements made in interviews,
we know
that Severus did not *really* understand the depth of the disagreement.  He
refused to believe [Lily][]'s aversion to the [Dark Arts][] was real or well
founded, and believed that she would find membership in the Death Eaters
*impressive*.[^221206-1]

These interview statements give credence to statements made by [Lupin][] and
[Sirius][], who are in and of themselves, perhaps not the most unbiased of
witnesses.  Sirius states that even in school, Severus was "up to his eyes in
the Dark Arts."[^221220-4]  The man who thinks that [Lily][] would find
membership in the Death Eaters impressive, and who invented the
[sectumsempra][] curse[^221220-5] no doubt really *was* using [dark][] magic
regularly - just not in front of [Lily][], who objected to it (for some strange
irrational reason - or so Severus thinks).  When he says that [James][] used
spells that Severus invented against him (Severus), how did [James][] learn
these?  Only because Severus *used* them against [James][].  Which of Severus'
spells do we see [James][] use though?  Not the [dark][] slashing curse, but
the prank spell.   [James][] may frequently have used superior numbers, and his
pranks may certainly have crossed the line into bullying behaviour (which is
deplorable), but *Severus* returned fire with [dark][] magic, whenever [Lily][]
was not around.

Coming out of [Hogwarts][], Severus joins the Death Eaters, while continuing
his studies in potions.  We do not know what the balance of his time is; we do
not know what (if any) atrocities he participated in.  We do know that he gets
the dark mark, we do not know if he had it prior to hearing the prophesy
fragment or not.  Was it a reward, or did he earn the mark in some other way?
That answer could significantly change your view of how much evil Severus has
done by commission versus omission during this phase of his life.

[Hogwarts]: <../../../hogwarts>

[Dumbledore][]'s view is that becoming a spy balances the scales.  Severus
needs no punishment for his actions prior to hearing the prophesy.[^221014-1]  I
cannot agree.  He may have earned some clemency, but not full clemency, and not
without a true trial.  [Dumbledore][] is not God.

[^221014-1]: It is possible that I overstate Dumbledore's opinion, he may
    simply believe that Severus is too useful out of prison, and thus that it
    must be *as if* the scales are balanced.

Returning to the memories that Severus would show [Harry][],[^210106-3] Severus
says "he thinks it means Lily Evans!" - a curious statement considering that
[Lily][] has in fact been Lily Potter for some time.[^210106-4] It is in fact
*because* she is Lily Potter that [Riddle][] would be after her and her son.
Severus is showing evidence of denial about the strength of the attachment
between [Lily][] and [James][], and a failure to understand what love really
means.

[Riddle]: <../../riddle/tom_marvolo>

Some writers have tried to give Severus a pass on this one.  They rightly point
out that there was no chance that [Riddle][] would spare the entire family, and
particularly no chance he would spare [Harry][].  They miss the fact that
Severus is still concerned only for [Lily][] when talking to *[Dumbledore][]*,
who *would* be concerned for the whole family.  It is perhaps a bit debatable
how much we can read into the conversation on the hill, but when asked if he
cares about the deaths of [Lily][]'s husband and child, it says "Snape said
nothing" then follows by Snape saying something.[^211220-1]  For that to make
sense, there is a pause.  The writers who want to give Severus a pass on this
will point out that Severus is risking his life by making the request, and why
should he for an enemy?  Would [James][] have done so had the situations been
reversed?[^221014-2]  When looking at the conversation with [Riddle][] this
perhaps matters, but again, when looking at the conversation with
[Dumbledore][] there was no risk at trying to more perfectly preserve life.
Sure enough, [Harry][], our hero, *does* risk his life to save [Draco][],
despite the enmity between them, despite the fact that [Draco][] has once again
put everyone at risk by threatening the hunt in the Room of Requirement.

I do not expect Severus to be a saint, to risk his life for [James][], who he
hates.  But note that isn't precisely what [Dumbledore][] asked.  He asked
about *[Lily][]'s husband who happens to be [James][]*.  In other words, would
you save [James][] for her sake.  Even put in those terms, Severus can barely
bring himself to say "them" and not just "her."  I again remind you that he
cannot bring himself to think of her as *actually married.*  Rather, she is a
prize to be won, some*thing* that [James][] has taken from him.  That is the
sense in which he wants her life to be saved.

[Riddle][] might well have been willing to go along with that, but it is not
just a quirk of cannon that [Lily][] was not.  We know that [Tobias][] Snape was
abusive, and that [Eileen][] Snape failed to protect Severus, but I know of no
evidence that [Eileen][] did not love her son.  Some abused women fail to protect
their children because they are unable to, not because they are unwilling to do
so; we do not know which category [Eileen][] Snape falls into. This flaw in
understanding is not solely attributable to his upbringing.  Some will point
out the way Snape was poorly dressed as proof, but this could be simply
symptomatic of the same cluelessness of non-magical fashion we see in other
magical characters coupled with their extreme poverty.

[Tobias]: <../tobias>

[Eileen]: <../../prince/eileen>

Regardless, Severus is now, supposedly, a spy for [Dumbledore][].  How much does
he know?  Does he know that Pettigrew is a Death Eater?  Does he know this
before [Riddle][] goes to Godric's Hallow?  What precisely does Severus report
to [Dumbledore][] during the 19 months or so between the prophesy stating that
[Harry][] *will* be born, and Halloween of 1981?  The answers to these
questions also play a critical part in assessing Severus Snape, and yet are
unanswered.

Severus becomes a teacher in the fall of 1982, replacing
[Slughorn][].[^210523-1]  It is really really hard to form an objective
understanding of Severus as a teacher.  Most of the time we see his class, he
puts directions on the board and expects the students to brew a potion without
help, while he stalks the room criticising those he dislikes (most of them).  I
have not end-to-end read the series in a few years now, and I cannot find with
spot checking the books any examples of him doing anything else.  I have this
vague memory, however, of at least one example of a lecture in potions class.
Is he a poor teacher because he does not know how to be better, because he has
been ordered to teach poorly by [Riddle][], or because he has been ordered to
teach poorly by [Dumbledore][] as part of maintaining his cover?  If it is
because he does not know how to teach better, do either [Dumbledore][] or
[McGonagall][] offer to mentor him, or is he left to flounder on his own? It is
necessary to know the answer to these questions, because his subject is
critical to several really important career paths when you are considering
society's ability to resist [Riddle][] or any other future dark lord. It is
especially critical to know the answer to these questions when Mrs. Rowling
states in an interview that [Dumbledore][] thinks that dealing with horrible
teachers is part of teaching his students about life.[^210412-6]

[Slughorn]: <../../slughorn/horace_eugene_flaccus>

Irregardless of if he does ever actually teach, his behaviour during these "lab"
classes is unacceptable.  The labs are unsafe, and his treatment of the students
unprofessional.  I suspect, however, that it would be _legal_ in, say, 1800s
England, and as the wizarding world seems to have frozen at least a century ago,
Severus is probably not doing anything punishable, just something reprehensible.

His behaviour as Head of House is another issue.  Again, it is not something
that the DMLE could take exception to, except in that if he had had a trial,
and if he were on probation, this would probably violate, or at least call into
question, the terms of that probation.  Severus is very much furthering the
atmosphere that he himself experienced as a student.  How much of this is
because he is allowed to, and how much is because he is instructed to?
[Dumbledore][] is never seen to use his power as Chief of the Wizengamot or
Supreme Mugwump (I refuse to believe these are powerless).  How much of
Severus's behaviour in the school is part of [Dumbledore][]'s plans for setting
up the final confrontation when [Riddle][] returns?  We do not know.  We do
have clues, [Dumbledore][] does seem to, extremely gently, remonstrate Severus
about his views of [Harry][].  This *suggests* that [Dumbledore][] is
permissive, not legislative about Severus.  I think that [Dumbledore][] wants
them all, Severus included, to turn away from these acts spontaneously inspired
purely by example, without any influence of punishment.

Severus, as Head of House, is acting in loco parentis, I think, even more than
the Headmaster does.  It is his responsibility to help form his students; his
failure to punish them is neglect.  His covering for them is teaching them to
disregard moral standards.  His behaviour implicitly and sometimes explicitly
rewards bad behaviour.  This is a problem.

Severus's behaviour during [Harry][]'s third year, and particularly during the
confrontation in the Shrieking Shack, is enlightening.  He enters the scene
"full of suppressed triumph"[^210510-3], proceeds to look fanatical[^210510-4],
and continues on in both book description and in objective assessment of his
behaviour, to be "deranged."[^210510-5]  He is, in this encounter, motivated by
three things.  One, Severus both fears and hates werewolves, no doubt stemming
from his teen-aged encounter with [Lupin][].  Two, Snape has a rational hatred
of [Sirius][] Black taken to an irrational degree.  With that Snape has an
inability to separate [Sirius][] from [James][], and [James][] from [Harry][]
Potter.  In Snape's mind anything done by one is effectively done by all three.
Third, Snape has an incredible desire for fame and recognition. I think this
sequence, as Snape yells at [Harry][], looking for him to thank him "on bended
knee"[^210510-6], and then later, with Fudge talking about the Order of Merlin,
gives us a huge insight into Snape's character.[^210523-2]

[Lupin]: <../../lupin/remus_john>

As [Riddle][] returns, what does Snape know about his activities?  What could
he have told [Dumbledore][] but chooses to hold back?  What does he tell
[Dumbledore][] publicly (at least in front of other Order members) versus what
he shares in private alone?  What does [Dumbledore][] know (from Severus's
reports) but refuse to act on?  We do not know the answer to these questions;
we cannot assess Severus as a spy.  Knowing these answers is important to know
if he was ever truly redeemed, or if he was putting on a show for [Dumbledore][].
Ultimately, knowing these answers is also important to assess *[Dumbledore][]* -
for while he faced the classic problem of when to act on knowledge gained from a
spy, his inaction cannot be wholly excused.

Severus becomes Headmaster during what would have been [Harry][]'s seventh year.
We get only a few glimpses of his tenure.  We know that he catches [Ginny]
attempting to steal the sword for [Harry][]; he must have had access to her
unprotected mind, but he assigns her detention with *Hagrid.*  [Harry][] is
right, [Ron][] is wrong; that was not intended as a serious detention.  How
much worse would [Hogwarts][] have been had a different Death Eater been
Headmaster?  How much could Severus have done to curb problems that he did not
do?  We cannot know.  We know he helped some at least.

[Ron]: <../../weasley/ronald_bilius>

[Ginny]: <../../weasley/ginevra_molly/>

Severus is trying to reach [Harry][] when [Riddle][] decides [Harry][] must die.
He (Severus) uses his the last of his strength to give [Harry][] memories
necessary for [Harry][] to finally have a true understanding of the situation.
At least some of this is because Severus is committed to following
[Dumbledore][]'s plans.  The extra memories of Severus's life are, in my opinion,
necessary if [Harry][] is to believe the final, critical memories of Severus's
interactions with [Dumbledore][].  The extra memories are not, I think,
*entirely* altruistic however.  Remember what we saw from book 3; Severus is
driven beyond reason by the twin desires of hatred for [Harry][]'s father, and
desire for recognition.  This is Severus's moment for both.  [Harry][] *must*
believe him, for if [Harry][] does not, then Severus will die a death eater.
If [Harry][] believes, then Severus dies a hero.  This is critical not only in
a moral sense, but for Severus's self image. *[Harry][] must think well of
Severus or no one will;* and nothing could be more important to Severus,
*except,* perhaps, that [James][]'s son might suffer more.  These memories can
achieve both.  If [Lily][]'s son must die, then Severus was going to get
everything he could out of it.  I think his motivation was thus complex.

For Severus *is* a complex character.  He was not irredeemable, and even though he
is fictional, there are enough questions about his life that I cannot judge him.
I can say that were I [Harry][], I would never have named a child after him.  I
hope I would forgive him, but I cannot honour him.  He could have been so much
greater than he was.

On a side note, it is widely speculated that Severus is [Draco][]'s godfather.
[This][lc1] article does not specifically talk about that, but covers the
available evidence as if it were.[^210517-6]

[Draco]: <../../malfoy/draco_lucius>

If you want a parallel but diverging view of Severus that allows for redeeming
him more than this rant does, BajaB offers a fascinating take on him in
[Chapter 4][ffnvo1] of her series of loosely connected one-shots _[Veritas
Oracle][ffnvo2]_.[^210603-1]

[^210523-2]: On a side note, how much of Fudge's distrust of Harry is based on
    this episode, and how much is based on Rita Skeeter's articles across the
    tournament?  Were Rita's articles in part possible *because* of this
    encounter?  She is nasty and vindictive enough to go for Harry on her own,
    but perhaps she had heard rumours of Harry having been confounded?  Magical
    Britain does seem like the sort of society that would blame a victim of such
    an attack.
