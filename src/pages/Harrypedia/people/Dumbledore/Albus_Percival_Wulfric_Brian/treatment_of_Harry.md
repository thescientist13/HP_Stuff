title: Dumbledore's Treatment of Harry
author: Luke Schierer
---

In explaining his decisions to [Harry], [Dumbledore] says:

> Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had
> planned and intended. Well not quite whole. You had suffered. I knew you
> would when I left you on your aunt and uncle’s doorstep. I knew I was
> condemning you to ten dark and difficult years.[^210912-2]

> You arrived at Hogwarts, neither as happy nor as well nourished
> as I would have liked, perhaps, yet alive and healthy. You were not
> a pampered little prince, but as normal a boy as I could have hoped
> under the circumstances. Thus far, my plan was working well.[^210912-3]

He justifies this saying:

> My answer is that my priority was to keep you alive. You were in more danger
> than perhaps anyone but myself realised. Voldemort had been vanquished hours
> before, but his supporters and many of them are almost as terrible as he
> were still at large, angry, desperate, and violent. And I had to make my
> decision too with regard to the years ahead. Did I believe that Voldemort
> was gone forever? No. I knew not whether it would be ten, twenty, or fifty
> years before he returned, but I was sure he would do so, and I was sure too,
> knowing him as I have done, that he would not rest until he killed
> you.[^210912-4]

There are two problems with this, and they are connected.

First is the prophecy.  From her website FAQ,

> The prophecy Harry hears in Dumbledore’s office suggests to me that both he
> and Voldemort will have to die, is that true?
>
> Both Madam Trelawney and I worded the prophecy extremely carefully and that
> is all I have to say on the subject![^210912-5]

I am speculating here, but everything I've read and heard about Mrs. Rowling
suggests that for all the flaws that I and others have pointed out, she tried
*really really* hard in planning the novels out.  I think her comment about
wording the prophecy very carefully applies to more than just Harry's encounter
with [Riddle][] at the end.  She says that in her opinion this prophecy is like
that in [Macbeth][WSM1], it is a catalyst a series of events, but that the
characters retain free will.[^210912-6]  I think that [Harry][]'s suffering,
not just his death experience in the forest in book seven, are one of the
things it triggered.  For all the prophesy does not name [Dumbledore][], it
shapes his actions much as the one that Macbeth hears shapes his actions.

In the fan fiction work _[The Sound of Silence][BW95TSS1]_ [Dumbledore][]
states:

> I couldn't stand what I did to that poor, poor child. But I knew it was
> necessary. Our society needed time to heal, to recover from the first blood
> war. Voldemort will come back if Harry lives, but no one can kill Harry
> except Voldemort. The Dursleys certainly did their level best to kill him.
> They couldn't.
>
> The stronger Harry is, the stronger Voldemort is. He will return. It is only
> through the actions that I have already taken that he hasn't already
> returned. As you judge me, remember the war. Remember what it was
> like.[^210912-7]

Mrs. Rowling does not allow her version of [Dumbledore][] to admit any such
thing, but I think there is some element of truth to this take on his
character.  If, however, I am off base, it makes the next point even stronger.
That being said, consider the following quote, this one from nonjon's
_[Whatever Happened to the Likely Lad?][]_:

> Harry nodded. "Now if he'd taken me to proper healers, they would have
> recognized the taint and worked out a way to get it out of me. So naturally,
> his plan calls for ensuring no one from the wizarding world can contact me or
> ever find out just what's so special about the legendary curse scar. Because
> he knows, left untreated it'll just become more ingrained as a part of
> me."[^221006-1]

[^221006-1]: nonjon. _[Whatever Happened to the Likely Lad?][]_. Published 2011-09-19.

Here nonjon has [Harry][] succinctly put forward the theory that the soul
fragment that sought to attach itself to [Harry][] is only irrevocably attached
to him *because [Dumbledore][] delayed treatment.*  Had medical help been
sought promptly, [Harry][] need not have faced that soul crushing walk into
the forest at the end of book seven, there would already have been one fewer
soul fragments to handle.  Is the *very limited* protection that [Harry's][]
attempt at sacrifice provides worth that suffering?  Even if it is, is it
*morally permissible* to *inflict* that on a child?

In the fan fiction work _[After Destiny][CAD1]_, cambangst presents a view of
[Harry][], [Ginny], and the other student fighters that is overly
influenced by modern secular morality, but shows them struggling with the
traumas they have faced in a way that I *do* find very realistic.  The
following is part of an exchange between [Harry] and [Ginny].

> "Training, Harry." She really wanted to smack him again, but settled for
> doing her best Hermione, instead. "Do you know how long Charlie had to train
> before they would even let him near a dragon?" He shook his head. "Four
> months. Four months, five days a week, eight hours a day. And that was after
> getting the highest N.E.W.T. score in Care of Magical Creatures since
> Grindelwald's War." Ginny leaned closer, until they were almost nose to
> nose. "Remind me, Harry, how much training did you get for this job?"
>
> Harry blinked a few times and then looked down. "A few evenings with
> Dumbledore."[^210912-1]

As I stated on the main [Dumbledore][AD1] page, I believe that Dumbledore, at
heart, embraces some  version of [utilitarianism][].  Rightly or wrongly, he
believed that the [horcrux][] in [Harry][] required that [Harry][] be
destroyed, or in other words, he would have to die.[^210912-9]  Under
utilitarian theory, while [Harry]'s death might be tragic, it is
outweighed by the salvation it would bring to the rest of society when
[Riddle] is vanquished.  Thus [Harry] must be programmed towards
self-sacrifice.

[utilitarianism]: https://www.schierer.org/~luke/log/Society/utilitarianism/

Again, Mrs. Rowling never allows her version of [Dumbledore][] to admit that he
has intentionally worked towards this end.  Her version of [Dumbledore][]
claims that the whole thing was, from beginning to end, entirely [Harry][]'s
free choice, and in a sense that is true.  It is true in the sense that no one
held a gun to his head and forced his action.  [Dumbledore][] was much more
subtle than that.  He allowed [Harry][] to spend ten years in an [abusive
environment][].  He allowed [Snape][SS1] to belittle and torment [Harry][].  He
did nothing as the school as a whole turned on [Harry][] in first
year,[^210912-10] second year,[^210912-11] fourth year,[^210912-12] *and*
fifth year.[^210912-13]

Even the lack of training fits into this.  Dumbledore tells [Harry][] that love
is the "power" leaving [Harry][] confused at first, but knowing that when the
final bits of the puzzle are revealed, it will all make sense - an untrained
[Harry][] has no other weapon in his arsenal except the power of his
self-sacrifice with which to protect his friends.  He even tells [Harry][] that
he depended on [Hermione] to *slow [Harry][] down*[^20210913-1] and while
they were specifically talking about the Hallows, when you consider that
[Hermione] also slowed down the hunt for the [horcruxes][] (see her page
for details), I feel safe including this in my indictment.

[horcrux]: <../../../../magic/dark/horcruxes>

[horcruxes]: <../../../../magic/dark/horcruxes>

When you consider the potential cost if [Riddle][] had not been stopped, and
further consider the fact *that it worked*, it is very hard to argue with
[Dumbledore][].  The fact that [Harry][] not only does not blame him, but feels
great affection for him makes it even harder.  There is just one problem.
[Utilitarianism][] is wrong.

The second problem is closely related to the first.  Suppose for a moment that
[Dumbledore][] was truly concerned with keeping [Harry][] alive, not because he
needed him to die at the right time or in the right way, but because it was the
right thing to do.  This supposes a few things:

* [Harry][] was a risk of death.  Above I referenced a version of
  [Dumbledore][] who states that only [Riddle][] could kill [Harry][].  In
  placing [Harry][] with the [Dursleys][], [Dumbledore][] is admitting that is
  probably not true.
* Some have speculated that placing [Harry][] with the [Dursleys][] was done to
  forestall other placements, for example with the [Malfoys][].[^221129-2]
  This is predicated on the idea that [James][]' mother was [Dorea Black][].
  Mrs. Rowling has refuted this.[^221129-3]  As things currently stand, our
  knowledge of the [Black][] and [Potter][] family trees excluded any
  sufficiently direct and close linkage that would give [Narcissa Malfoy][] any
  particularly strong claim to young [Harry][].
* The [Wizengamot][] would be prepared to back a non-magical claim to custody
  over a magical one.  We have no information either way on this.

Given the above implications, [Harry][] was in fact at risk of death *from the
[Dursleys][]*.  Despite my use of it above, the fan fiction work _[The Sound of
Silence][BW95TSS1]_ is at least partly wrong, [Riddle][] is *not* the only
person who can kill [Harry][].  Thus when they denied him food, he was in
danger of starving.  When Petunia aims a frying pan at his head, the head
injury could have been quite serious.[^221129-4]  This in turn means that
[Dumbledore][]'s actions, or inactions, in leaving [Harry][] with the
[Dursleys][] despite at least some knowledge of the "dark and
difficult"[^221129-5] nature of this time, is moral complicity in the emotional
neglect and physical abuse.  Again (because it bares repeating),
[Utilitarianism][] is wrong.

[Dumbledore][] is frequently portrayed as tricky, and interestingly, the first
problem would be largely avoidable if the second were not true, and the second
would be largely negated if the justification presented in _[The Sound of
Silence][BW95TSS1]_ *were* true.  So [Dumbledore][] will insist any time
someone objects that [Harry][] must go to the [Dursleys][] because he will be
safest there.  Safest from what/who?  [Dumbledore][] can now start to use the
complicated nature of the thorny problem to confuse the listener.

    I have chosen to quote Mrs. Rowling to substantiate this rather than something she's had Dumbledore say because I feel this puts it even more beyond doubt than anything else I could do.  I am essentially saying that Dumbledore's deductions, intuitions, whatever you chose to attribute it to, would end up agreeing with the author's own opinion on the subject.
