### Analysis

Mrs. Rowling tells us, [apocryphally][] that Kingsley would be an effective and
long lasting Minister of Magic.[^221205-2]  I find it curious that he is
apparently a pure-blooded[^221205-3] member of the so called "Sacred
Twenty-Eight" that ends up as Minister.  This is hardly a revolutionary choice.
It is hardly surprising then that some fan fiction authors choose instead to
show him as ineffective, embroiled in corruption, or both.
