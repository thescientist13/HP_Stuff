### Analysis

#### Weasley Ages

The ages for Bill and Charlie are hard. This is in part because of the Harry Perception Bias.[^240101-3] It is hard to say if it is because [Harry] choses not to mentally note the events or if it is because of actual examples of neglect, but there are no birthdays for anyone _other_ than him in any of the books. We have a slight indication that it is because Mrs. Rowling did not include them in [Harry]'s awareness filter when we hear about Ron's pocket watch.[^240401-4]

- [Harry] is born in 1980.
- Per PotterMore[^20190327-1] [Ron] was born on 1980-03-01.
- Per PotterMore[^20190327-2] [Fred] and [George] were born on 1978-04-01.
- PotterMore does not list [Percy]'s birth year (his birthday is August 22)[^20190327-3]. I'm going to assume a [Hogwarts] cutoff of September 1.
  [Percy] is in 5th year when [Harry] is in 1st, so [Percy] is 4 years
  older - 1976.
- [Charlie] and [Bill] are harder. I'm going with the [Harry Potter
  Lexicon][lexicon] date for them.
- Per the [lexicon],[^20190327-4] [Charlie] has a birthday of December 12 1972. Again, note the September 1st cut off, Charlie might as well
  have been born in 1973 for school year purposes.
- Per the [lexicon],[^20190327-5] [Bill] has a birthday of November 29, 1970.

| [Ron]          | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0    | 1    | 2    | 4    | 7    | 8    | 9    | 10   | 11   | 12   | 13   | 14   | 15   | 16   | 17   | 18   |
| [Ginny]        | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0    | 1    | 3    | 6    | 7    | 8    | 9    | 10   | 11   | 12   | 13   | 14   | 15   | 16   | 17   |

One of the interesting things about this is that it means [Charlie]'s
seventh year is the year before [Harry] and [Ron] start. The books go
on and on about how [Charlie] "could have played for England"[^20200629-2]
, and then in [Harry]'s third year Wood says that "Gryffindor hasn't
won for seven years now."[^20200629-3] Per the chart above, this means
that [Gryffindor] last won in 1985,[^20210601-3] [Charlie]'s second
year. From this I'm going to conclude that the great [Quidditch] player,
never won a season as captain of the team.

Now we know from [Harry]'s own [Quidditch] career that a winning seeker
can have a losing season, but in [Harry]'s case that is only because of
games he didn't play. Still, it is sufficient grounds that I won't
entirely hold that against [Charlie]. More damning is the fact that Wood
is captain his fifth, [Harry]'s first, year, and _[Fred] and [George]
memorised Wood's speech from last year._[^20200728-1] Why in the world
was [Charlie] not captain in his seventh year? Why was a Fourth year
student given what is apparently the same rights as a prefect if a
seventh year student, who was both a good player and had been
captain, was still available?

So with a keeper (Wood) good enough to be made captain a year early, an
apparently excellent seeker ([Charlie]), and a decent if young pair of
chasers (Angelina and Alicia) [Gryffindor] could not win the 1990 season?
This is a strong argument that the above dates despite the pedigree of
their source material must be wrong, and that there must in fact be
more space between [Charlie] and [Ron].

Countering that, in the fourth book, [Bill] says he has not been at
[Hogwarts] in five years.[^20210601-2] That statement comes at the end
of the 1994-1995 school year, placing [Bill]'s last year in 1989, which
_does_ match the chart above (school year 1988-1989). If [Bill]'s
birthday is correct, that does not give much space for [Charlie]'s to move.
