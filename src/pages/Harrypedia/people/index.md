## People in Harry Potter

I initially started keeping my notes on people and relationships in Harry
Potter in [Gramps][] however, this required a jumping through a lot of hoops to
make it accessible. I needed to export it out in multiple formats, first as an
extended family tree of sorts (Gramps calls this a "relationship graph") and
secondly as a "narrated website." This second then had to have a complicated
series of sed statements run on it to make it compatible with [ikiwiki][] and
fit into the generated page content style of the rest of my [Random Unfinished
Thoughts][RUT]. All this meant that my notes on who people are genealogically
and how they relate to each other were totally separate from my notes on their
personalities, motivations, backstories, abilities, and so on. This was
unacceptable. This site attempts to combine that information into a single
more accessible and more unified experience. We will see how well I succeed.
