title: The Society that Allowed Riddle

Like other fan fiction writers before me, I am curious about how [Riddle] came to
have the power to rock magical world the way he did.  Again, like others before
me, it seems clear that the answer to this lies not just in his personal power
or personal charisma, but at least in part in the society that he so devastated.
What, then, did this society look like?  Why, ultimately, was [Riddle] possible?

Rowling has confirmed that she deliberately drew parallels between the magical
society that [Harry] reenters at age eleven and that of Nazi
Germany.[^211004-1] However, as I have noted elsewhere in these
[notes], Mrs. Rowling does not make incredibly
consistent use of real world history, thus the parallel she is attempting to
draw is flawed.[^211004-2]  If you strip away the magical bonds stuff that
Radaslab adds[^211004-3], and the technomacy stuff that Aaran St Vines
adds,[^211004-4], both come up with remarkably interesting solutions to this
problem.  Both assume that the Wizengamot is a long-standing institution in the
governance of wizarding Britain, despite the fact that we can only reliably date
it from 1544.[^211004-5]  Both assume that its membership

 * is largely hereditary, 
 * is dominated by families that have, historically, been more concerned
   by age than [blood status],
 * has some form of tiered voting,
 * is usually populated by people who are grandparent or even great-grandparent
   age,
 * came to delegate some or all of its authority to the [Ministry of
   Magic].

Both further speculate that the Potters have a hereditary seat on the
Wizengamot, that said seat wields a fair amount of power, and that seat becomes
central to the plot without making the story solely a political thriller.  This
last bit is probably the biggest problem with the scenario, Mrs. Rowling tells us
that only two Potters have sat on the Wizengamot, but that both were effectively
at critical times in history.[^211004-6]  As I state in my [Potter
Family notes], the coincidental timing
makes me think that perhaps the Potters typically appoint proxies for some
unknown reason, but that theory is a stretch.  Leaving aside the exact
structure of the Wizengamot, lets assume the above speculation is essentially
accurate.  It still does not tell us enough. 

Mrs. Rowling tells us that while the blood status ideology may have started with
[Slytherin][Salazar], it did not really gain prominence or social
acceptance until the Statute of Secrecy came into effect.[^211004-7]  While 270
or 280 years, depending on when you date [Riddle]'s power base from, is a long
time, it pales beside the amount of time that Jews have been used as scapegoats
by various European leaders.  The Nazi party was building on a well established
and fairly popular prejudice.  When you consider that witches and wizards may
very well commonly live to be as much as 150 or 200 years old[^211004-8], then
the prominence of the blood status ideology came into prominence while the
parents of the ruling generation were alive (at least for the first war, if not
also the second).  In other words, people in the magical world may not remember
it being an "unusual and misguided view",[^211004-9] but the ones in charge of
society remember making that view something more nearly mainstream.  There
should not be the cultural habit of blaming everything on them, or of
dehumanising them the way we see with Jews in Germany.  Excluding them from any
real political power quite possibly, but within the context of some existing
[class structure].
