Blood Purity bigotry is a central theme of the Harry Potter series. But how
did it come to be? Is it truly ignorant nonsense, or is there a reason for it?

### Mrs. Rowling's Premise

Mrs. Rowling writes that magical folk feared violation of the Statute of
Secrecy, which in turn was caused by persecution by Muggles.[^220705-4] There
are some problems with this. The biggest problems are her bogus version of
United States History[^220705-5] and the fact that witch hunting was largely
restricted to Europe and the New England areas, so why would the rest of the
world vote for it?

### Bad arguments

The most common reason fan fiction authors adopt is essentially xenophobia.
Wizards have some unique cultural elements, and that culture is diluted
and, eventually, lost by the inclusion of children with non-magical
heritage. The biggest problem with this argument is the forced
inclusion that the young child of non-magical heritage experiences.
He or she _does not choose to immigrate_. In no story featuring this
argument has there _ever_ been a _real_ choice for the young student.
Come to Hogwarts, effectively immigrating from non-magical Britain to
magical Britain, or lose your magic, possibly with disastrous
consequences for your future health, happiness, or both. Oh, and by
the way, we aren't going to _tell_ you that you _are_ immigrating until
_after_ you have made the choice _and_ come to regret it. See more on
this [here][Immigration]

The next most common argument is essentially that the magical bigot is
_right_. This is, if anything worse. The whole robes are better,
parchment exists for a reason, you need to be told everything style of
these stories grates. I talk about that [here][Condescension]

### A Reasonable Premise

At first this is a slight variation of the bad ideas, one that I have
read very few times, but the difference is profound. Instead of
speaking to observed particulars from the books, the indicia of the
cultural differences, this argument focuses on fundamental viewpoint.
The premise is that the person of non-magical heritage will never look
to magic as a first solution, but will always instinctively do things
the "muggle" way when possible. That this non-magical bias limits
their appreciation for, practice in, and ultimately ability at magic.
That many will attempt to explain things scientifically when magic has
no such constraints, and in so doing self limit.

With just a few short examples, these stories can present a rationale
for the bigotry that allows it to be _wrong_ but _rational_. That is,
we can see why the ideology attracts people, even while we condemn some
of the conclusions.
