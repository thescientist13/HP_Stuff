_[The Accidental Animagus]_ fan fiction author White Squirrel speculates that not only did society take an abrupt shift, with the pure-blood mania becoming more prominent than it had ever been, but that the magical society probably started to rewrite its own history, erasing evidence of its dealings with non-magical society, and of its own mutations and shifts over time.  

This idea is supported by lesser canonical sources.  In England, the [Potters] argue for the Statute to protect the Muggles,[^20200810-3] the [Malfoys] argue against it (to continue exploiting the wealthy among whom [Malfoys] often marry).[^20200810-4]  Once it passes, the [Malfoys] pretend to have been in favour all along.[^20200810-5]
