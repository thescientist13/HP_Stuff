12 Grimmauld Place is said to be the ancestral home of the [Black
family][Black].  This is curious in a couple of respects.  

* Why would the notoriously bigoted [Blacks][Black] *want* a house owned by
  someone non-magical in the first place?[^211020-1] We are told they think of
  themselves as some sort of wizarding nobility,[^211020-2] they should desire
  an old manner house or castle, not a relatively modern town house. 
* The house is oddly animated.  We do not *really* know to what extent that is
  normal for magical homes, but the idea that [Walburga][]'s portrait can open
  curtains, resist those curtains being closed, and refuse commands from the
  house's owner seems like more than would be tolerated.[^211020-3]

Lots of fan fiction authors have either insisted that [James Potter][James]'s
mother must be [Dorea Black][Dorea], or similarly placed in the [family
tree][Black] to explain how it is possible for [Harry][] to inherit the house.
The [Harry Potter Wiki] has a simpler and better explanation: the English
Common Law concept of the [Entailed Estate][wEE1].[^211020-4]  If there are no
male Blacks living, and the house was entailed to the male line, then the
entail is broken and [Sirius][] is free to pass the house on tho whomever he
desires in his will.  *Perhaps* the will could be challenged if [Sirius][] had
willed the house to someone entirely unrelated, but he is [Harry][]'s
god-father and thus (were he free to assume the role) legal guardian.  In the
absence of an immediate family of his own, providing a legacy for his ward and
god-child is expected and natural.

### More on [Walburga]'s Portrait

Are wizards so short sighted that it never occurred to them to destroy the
Portrait in some way, given it cannot be moved?

* It is possibly shielded.[^211020-5]
* It is possibly on a load-bearing wall, and so the wall it is on cannot be
  physically destroyed.[^211020-6]
* She may have bound her soul to it in a pseudo-[horcrux]y
  way.[^211020-7] This may give it some of the same protections from harm.
