title: Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA)
author: Luke Schierer

Mrs. Rowling would have this established in 1693[^210228-8] with the primary
end of enforcing the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy, and
eradicating the "Scourers."[^210228-9] These last are apparently a group of
magical users who have somehow become anti-magic, and now hunt other magical
users.[^210228-10] There are a couple of problems with this.

1. Perhaps most importantly, the Declaration of Independence was not signed
   until July of 1776. The First Continental Congress was in September and
   October of 1774. Pick either date you like, but earlier than that especially
   over fifty years earlier, your average citizen was very much a British
   subject. There _was_ no "United States of America" for there to be a Magical
   Congress of, and the very idea would have been ludicrous to any except the
   most skilled practitioner of divination.
2. The government and society she describes ignores the fact that this newly
   established government would have no authority over the Native American
   tribes. The histories I see on [WizardingWorld][ww] do not account for any
   subjugation of the wizards and witches in these populations. I suspect that
   you would see few wands among them,[^220715-2] but that you _would_
   see varieties of animagi or at least methods of becoming one, unknown
   to Europe, as well as a wide variety of potions.
3. The government and society she describes ignores the Cajun culture, with its
   voodoo and spiritualism. In the Harry Potter world, this would be an area
   where the ISWS is stretched to the limit, and oblivators are running around
   like crazy.
4. I have seen fanfictions out there that suggest that Disney was either a squib
   or secretly a wizard. Either makes a fair amount of sense, much more than a
   harsh separation between the magical and non-magical world.
5. Wizards have trouble keeping up with the modern muggle world. How would an
   isolationist MACUSA deal with the influx of immigrants that came through
   Ellis Island, where _12 million_ immigrants would enter the US in a mere 62
   years starting in 1892?[^210228-11] It is unbelievable that some first
   generation wizards, refugees from pure-blood prejudice if nothing else, were
   not among that number. They came for the freedom that the non-magical
   government promises, they would be restless and rebellious if they arrived to
   find a repressive magical government in place.

For these and because as an American citizen myself the MACUSA concept is
distasteful, in any fanfiction I write that does for some reason touch upon the
wider world stage, MACUSA will be ignored. This necessarily means that the
prequel Fantastic Beasts movies will be used as cannon only where convenient.

My gut instinct is that Mrs. Rowling has created this extensive segment of
backstory in support of the Fantastic Beasts movies. However, as I show when
looking at [Professor McGonagall][MM1], she has actually _introduced_ problems
in even her own content with these books. Like with [Star Wars][], we are
seeing revisionist history.[^211018-4]

The problem with rejecting this backstory and these sections from Fantastic
Beasts is that it leaves us yet another plot hole. What sort of government
_does_ exist in the United States of America? If it is any kind of _reasonable_
government, then given how closely we ally with Great Britain, why has the US
government not helped alleviate the ignorance the UK government has concerning
the magical world?[^211210-1]

    This comes up in other works as well, but reading
    _[Exodus](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11460241)_ by Nigelcat1 triggered me to
    actually realise the severity of the problem.
