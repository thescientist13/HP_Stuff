## Misc notes on height

Any number of fan fiction authors will come up with some alternate description
of what [Harry][] looks like. This may be because he had a better childhood,
took a healing potion, participated in a healing ritual, or underwent some
other form of magical transformation. The results will vary considerably, and
no doubt reflect that, generally female, author's personal idea of what is
attractive in a male. Many of these are fairly unrealistic, especially when
they place [Harry][] at something over six feet tall somewhere in his teens.

Eventually this bugged me enough that I wanted to document the unrealistic
nature of these descriptions, so I looked up a "growth chart."[^220622-1] This
particular chart includes percentile information based on data partly specific
to the UK, and partly generalised from WHO.[^220622-2] While the data is from
1990, so are our characters, so the time frame is even reasonably accurate.
Looking at the chart, [Harry][] would have to be in roughly the 90th percentile
to hit 6"1' by age 17, and unless I am crossing lines, as much as the 98th
percentile to hit that by age 15. So while it is not _impossible_ that the
speculated healing ritual or potion has helped him to gain this height, in all
likelihood both parents would have to be noticeably very tall people.[^220622-3]

Given that we hear over and over again that [Harry][] _without_ extraordinary height
looks just like [James][], this seems … unlikely. We ought to be reading that he
"looks just like [James][], except shorter." Since we do not, my guess is that
[James][] was _not_ exceptionally tall. While [James][] _is_ described as
tall, and it is common for children to be taller than their parents, record
breaking height is almost always commented on when describing someone.
[James][] would need to be truly exceptionally tall to produce this six foot
[Harry][], not simply "tall." Notice for example how both [Hagrid][] and
[Flitwick][] are described.

Interestingly, I have noted a similar issue with girls in at least one fan
fiction.[^220726-8] The key consideration is that girls' growth drastically
slows in their 15th year and is essentially flat-lined by 16.[^220726-9]
Interestingly, for UK Girls, the 9th percentile of height at age 16 is
approximtely 5'1".[^220726-10] Depending on how short percentile-wise someone
has to be before being generally described _as_ "short," authors need to be
really careful with their descriptions. On the other hand, a girl's waist size
apparently increases every year through out her teen years.[^220726-11] If the
same is true of her bust size (which is awkward to google), then that may
explain what the author was _trying_ to convey in my one example.
