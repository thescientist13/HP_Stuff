The Siren are said to be the oldest of the Merpeople, and their human half, the
most human in appearance.[^211111-11] In more traditional folklore, there seems
to have been a transition over the centuries from a view of the Sirens as being
birds with the heads of women, to being half birds, to being half
fish.[^211111-12]
