House Elves are one of the more disturbing elements of the series. As others have noted before me[^HEaS], these beings are magically enslaved. To her credit,
Mrs. Rowling shows us exactly how evil the institution of slavery can be in the relationship that the [Malfoy]s and [Crouch]es have with their respective elves.

On the other hand, the relationship that [Harry] eventually forms with [Kreacher] shows a very different view of the situation. While it is easy to,
as [Hermione] does, dismiss the [Hogwarts] elves as brainwashed victims who know
no better, we come to know [Kreacher] more deaply. He _could_ still be a victim of his own upbringing, of the many centuries he has lived as a slave, but his love for [Regulas], and the concern he comes to feel for [Harry] is certainly genuine.

We know next to nothing about their magic, the _how_ of their enslavement, or their physical lifecycle. In typical Rowling fashion, what little we do know
is somewhat contradictory.[^240219-2]

I personally think that it _is_ necessary to explain why elves so rarely rebel
against this enslavement. It seems to me there are three reasonable explanations.

One is that they are decendants of wild [Brownies] who are routinely tricked into
magical contracts because wizarding law sees them as 1) wild manifestations of magic
and not beings at all and 2) intruders into a wizard's home, and thus the contract a
form of self defense.[^240219-3]

A second is that the elves get _something_ from the magic that enslaves them.[^240220-1]
Perhaps it is nurishment, perhaps it is lifespan, perhaps it is a source of power.
This does not justify slavery. The relationship need not be one of master slave just
because it _is_ one of master servant. One can recognize that the elf's payment is
non-monetary but that the elf is still a _person._

The third is that the magic is in fact _evil_ but that it is not trivially undone. That we can mitigate the effects by treating the elves well, but that,
due to the enchantment they are under, we cannot make the majority of them desire anything other than slavery. _They will seek slavery out_ not because
they are brainwashed (that could be cured), but because they are magically
compelled to do so. Just as the ability to inately throw off an [Imperius]
curse is rare, so to is the ability for an elf to resist this compulsion.
Here the solution to the situation is not societal, but _magical_, a counter-curse must be researched, developed, tested, and used. This is made
harder because the _curse_ in question is lost and unrecorded by history.[^240219-4]

[^240219-2]:
    In one extra-cannonical source she states House Elves live on
    average 200 years, while [Kreacher] is said (by her) to have lived
    over 600.
