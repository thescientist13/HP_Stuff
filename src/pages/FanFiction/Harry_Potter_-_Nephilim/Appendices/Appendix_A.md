## What is Cannon Here

I as per the [Introduction], this is a multi-way crossover. I am using
source material from Harry Potter, following the same rules I use in
the [Encyclopedic Reference].  I am then pulling in some stuff from
Madeleine L’Engle's _[Many Waters][MW]_, one or two concepts of demonology
from C. S. Lewis' _[The Screwtape Letters][TSL]_, some other myths and legends
(as Rowling herself does in places), and mixing that in with some actual history
and some actual theology.  Where necessary, I will force the history and the
theology to fit my story's needs, so the result is *really really* fictional.

### Cannon things you must recall

From each work there are certain things you must recall for anything here
to make sense.

#### Things you might have missed in Harry Potter that I am elaborating on

* In _[Goblet of Fire][]_, Harry is unwillingly entered into a *binding magical
  contract*.  I am making the assumption that Riddle and Crouch Jr. have Crouch
  Sr. spout a viable theory for why Harry has to compete.  That is, if he is
  *not* in fact in a binding magical contract, he *could be*, despite not
  having entered.  Riddle and Crouch Jr. will have to assume that Dumbledore,
  or another adult present, *might* do the responsible adult thing and object
  otherwise.  Thus it is *possible* in Mrs. Rowling's world to create a binding
  magical contract on unwilling participants.  See [Appendix F][AF]
* The Unbreakable Vow as described in _[Deathly Hallows][]_ is essentially a
  ritual to create a contract.  The magic is coming in part from the bonder, but
  in part from the two kneeling, which from earlier books, seems to be an
  essential component of the magic.  Thus beyond the magic learned at Hogwarts,
  there *are* others, including rituals.

#### Things Specifically Pulled from _[Many Waters][MW]_

* Being seduced by a fallen angel is not just a matter of falling in love with
  the wrong person, the fallen angel also seduces you into an evil ritual that
  corrupts your soul. I am going to extend this and call such a person a witch.
  See below for deviations from Harry Potter.
* The fallen angels directly interact with humanity and have visible
  manifestations of the powers they retain from their angelic nature.  I'm
  extending this to say that some of these are inherited.
* All of the angels and nephil found in _[Many Waters][MW]_ are, in Harry Potter
  terms, animagi.
  * These animal forms are symbolic in some way of the angel or nephil in
  * question.  Again, per above, I am not using L'Engle's definition of nephil,
    but I am keeping this aspect.
  * All nephil have the ability to be an animagi, and this transformation is,
    when not specifically suppressed, natural to them.
  * A given nephil may make this transformation difficult (essentially suppress
	the ability) by *believing it to be difficult*.  Thus some cultures have
	developed rituals surrounding unlocking the ability (such as Mrs. Rowling's
	canonical description of the process).

#### Things Specifically Pulled from _Screwtape_

* Lewis describes the effect of sin on the fallen angles in _[The Screwtape
  Letters][TSL2]_.[^210408-1]  At various places I talk about "bizarre" things
  happening to nephil.  This is more or less what I envision.  However, I will
  use language really loosely here, intentionally.
  * Sometimes this represents instances of Divine Justice, that is, God has so
    ordered the world (in this fictional universe) such that using magic a
    certain way has consequences.
  * Sometimes this represents the power God has given actual angels.  Using
    _[Many Waters][MW]_ as the source concept angels have a fair amount of
    autonomy and sometimes a lack of clarity in how best to execute their
    duties.  For those angels who did not rebel, their choices are never
    sinful, but sometimes suboptimal (see the intro about this being bad
    theology but good fiction).
  * Sometimes it represents something the nephil has him/her self done
    unintentionally that cannot be (or at least has not been) distinquished
    from the above categories.

  I am *intentionally* going to *frequently* be vague and downright
  inconsistent in my language about this, because it is (and always has been)
  unclear to both the nephilim and the clergy which of the three is happening.

### Things That Make This an Alternate Universe

#### Historical fabrications

* Witch hunting was a product of ignorance (sometimes poorly educated priests
  yes) and even more so of Protestantism.  The rejection of those parts of
  Sacred Tradition not contained in the Bible by Protestants caused them to
  reject the true understanding of the interactions between the fallen angels
  and humanity.
* I have adjusted the history of [The Priestly Fraternity of St Peter][FSSP].

#### Some Notable Differences from the actual Harry Potter universe

* Harry is noticeably out of character in this story.  I will try to make him
  the exception rather than the norm.  However, to the extent that characters
  are formed by their experiences across the actual Harry Potter series, they
  may end up in different places (emotionally/psychologically) between my first
  chapter and last, than they did between Mrs. Rowling's first book and last.
* Witches are those corrupted by union with fallen angels.  They do gain power
  (magic) from this union, but are corrupted by it.  Should they repent and
  receive forgiveness from their sins, they would also lose their access to
  magic.  It is from these people that the persistent rumours about non-magical
  people "stealing magic" come.  It is possible (in this story) for someone to
  *become* magical.
* Following from the origin of magic I'm using, magic will follow somewhat
  different [rules][ab] than the Harry Potter books. This includes both the
  way the characters use magic and magical creatures.
* Those that call themselves witches *are not actually.*  They are nephilim.
  That is, the actual characters you encounter are not what this story's true
  history would term a witch.
* Modern day welders of magic, heavily influenced by paganism and by those who
  have given into temptation, have obscured the difference between those who
  inherit magic and those who have gained it through sin. They call all female
  welders of magic witches, this is part denial, part self delusion, and part
  ignorance. Exactly how much of which differs from person to person.
* The Old Testament references to witches refer to those corrupted by union with
  fallen angels, not to the children of such unions (This is certainly bogus and
  entirely fictional theology, but it is necessary for world building).
* The Statue of Secrecy was imperfectly implemented.  At one point, knowledge of
  the a-fore bullet points was commonly taught to most clergy.  With the
  disruptions to the education of clergy wrought by the enlightenment, and
  worse, by the modern era, now only a few priests and bishops know this
  history.
* Magic users *are not human.*  Just like a hippogriff is a blend of the
  incompatible horse and eagle that is not fully one nor the other, the person
  who can use magic is a nephil, not a human.  See [Appendix H][ah]
* Note that in describing the nephilim in [Appendix H][ah], I hit on some other
  differences.  I have gone back and forth about trying to combine the two pages,
  hence the out of order lettering.  Duplicating information would be the worst
  of both worlds.

#### Things differing for those familiar with _[Many Waters][MW]_

* L'Engle calls the fallen angels the nephilim.  I'm using more orthodox
  theology and calling the progeny of the union of an angel and a human a nephil
  (I'm using seraph - seraphim, cherub - cherubim, nephil -
  nephilim).[^211201-1]
* L'Engle has all such end with the great flood.  Later passages in the Old
  Testament suggest that nephilim continue to exist after the flood.  I am
  positing that fallen angels continued to seduce women during the Old Testament
  times.

[^211201-1]: There is nothing truly unique in Fan Fiction.
    * In _[Error of Soul](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8490518)_
      Materia-Blade has a line referring to magical folk as Nephilim.  I came up
      with this idea well before I found that work.  Just goes to show that there
      is nothing possible that *someone* else hasn't also thought of. in
    * In _[Losing Control](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9157305)_
      JackPotr has an overlapping explanation of where magical humans came
      from.  I had read this before starting this work, but had totally
      forgotten until after I had fleshed out the primary Appendices and the
      first handful of chapters.
